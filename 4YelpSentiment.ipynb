            "     PRNewswire  Follow  2 minutes ago    BookmarkCancel Confirm    PR Newswire SEATTLE, June 15, 2022The next generation of Zillow surfing uses an AI-generated floor plan to bring together listing photos and 3D tours for a more authentic and seamless virtual home-shopping experience SEATTLE, June 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow surfing 2.0 is here. At a time when so many people are rethinking where and how they want to live, home shoppers in major markets across the country can get a deeper sense of a home than ever before without stepping foot inside.  Zillow's AI-generated floor plan — powered by Zillow tech but available to use for free on listings anywhere — serves as a dynamic guide to give shoppers digital insight and detail so they can more quickly and easily narrow their search to only the homes they love and want to see in person. Now, Zillow uses machine learning to not only generate floor plans, but also imports each listing photo and places it on the floor plan, giving shoppers an in-person perspective of a home's shape and flow that simply scrolling through can never do. \"Zillow surfing has always been about imagining all the possibilities a move could bring, and Zillow surfing 2.0 is bringing those possibilities to life in a much more interactive, realistic way,\" said Josh Weisberg, vice president of Zillow's Rich Media Experience team. \"Now shoppers can act more quickly and confidently, whether they're searching in their own neighborhood or hundreds or thousands of miles away. We're pushing the boundaries of what home buyers and renters can expect when shopping for a home online.\" For buyers and renters, Zillow's AI-generated floor plan means navigating more seamlessly and naturally through photos, a 3D Home tour and other listing information, getting a remarkably accurate sense of a home's flow and space. An hour of teleporting through interactive floor plans on Zillow can replace an afternoon, or longer, of scheduling tours and driving around town to see homes in person.  More than half (56%) of buyers agree they wasted time on their home search by viewing properties that they would have skipped if they had understood the floor plan before their visit. Almost three-quarters (74%) agree that a dynamic floor plan helps them determine if a home is right for them.1 The pandemic and the supercharged housing market that followed drove rapid adoption of tech tools that have fundamentally changed the way people buy and sell. With more virtual tours on Zillow listings than ever before, it's easier to explore and picture life in a home. Shoppers can evaluate homes from the comfort of their couch — assessing condition, validating details, layout, size and orientation — to make the most of their time. Or they can relive an in-person tour without traveling for a second visit. That speed is critical in today's ultracompetitive market, when homes are selling in just a week nationwide, and as quickly as four days in some areas. For agents and landlords, this new and expanded technology means bringing a listing to life and showing homes to more serious and interested shoppers. Eighty-one percent of buyers and 71% of renters said they were more likely to visit a home if the listing included a floor plan they liked. Zillow uses panoramic photos captured by an agent or photographer with the free 3D Home app and a 360-degree camera, and then applies the company's computer vision and machine-learning models to generate a 3D Home tour and interactive floor plan. This includes AI-predicted room dimensions, square footage and the location of the listing photos relative to the other media. And now, it also imports every listing photo and places them on the floor plan to more easily navigate and get a feel for the home. The floor plan, 3D tour and photos are automatically uploaded to the listing on Zillow and Redfin, and can also be added to the MLS, embedded in a website, or shared via email or social media. That's especially important for agents using Zillow's immersive virtual tours as a cost-effective way to showcase and share listings and generate more leads. In a survey this spring, 71% of sellers said they are more likely to hire an agent who includes virtual tours and/or interactive floor plans in their services. And three-quarters of sellers said including a floor plan was a highly important characteristic for their listing. \"Immersive floor plans give agents the ability to build a connection between potential buyers and listings prior to any showings,\" said George Laughton, founder of the Laughton Team in the Phoenix area. \"They give buyers a sense of familiarity and make them feel as though they've been in the home before, helping them establish a stronger emotional connection with the home.\" 1 According to data from the Zillow Consumer Housing Trends Report.

Would we have seen ChatGPT six years earlier? Would we see five other competitors competing for search? Those are questions none of us can answer.”Google has asked Mehta to throw out two antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department and state attorneys general before a scheduled trial in September. The Justice Department and a group of states separately sued in 2020, alleging that Google’s deals to ensure its search engine is preloaded on web browsers and mobile devices violate antitrust laws. Mehta is overseeing both lawsuits.Google’s attorney John Schmidtlein acknowledged that the agreements with Apple Inc. and smartphone manufacturers to be the default search engine give the company “an advantage,” but that doesn’t violate antitrust laws.“There’s absolutely an advantage, but it’s not insurmountable,” he said.Schmidtlein’s comments responded to questions from Mehta about whether Google’s default status gives it an edge that competitors can’t match.Story continues“There is self-reinforcing quality to these agreements,” Mehta said. “What seems to me to be unique is the product gets better just by having the default. Google, by virtue of having the defaults year after year after year, gathers more data and has the ability to return more accurate, more efficient search results.”Google first entered a contract with Apple to be the default search engine on its Safari browser in 2003, when Google was one of many search engines and Apple’s Mac computers were only a small sliver of the market, Schmidtlein said. The amount of money Google pays to Apple is confidential, but is in the billions of dollars each year.Mehta also pressed Google on why it continues to pay for the default position today when it is the undisputed leader in search.“They are paying to expose their product and make it available. Whether people switch is up to the user,” Schmidtlein said.Yet Dintzer, the Justice Department lawyer, said Google’s insistence on exclusivity and the size of those payments are key.“They are paying billions of dollars for these defaults. Google keeps saying, ‘It’s because people want us.’ If people wanted it, they wouldn’t be paying billions of dollars,” he said.Mehta pushed back on some of the Justice Department’s arguments, asking the Justice Department to specify what Google should have done differently.The company should have eliminated the exclusivity provision in its contracts once it gained a monopoly, Dintzer said. That would have allowed potential rivals to bid for access points on smartphones and browsers, he said, and would have let companies like Apple or Mozilla — the maker of the Firefox browser — design their products differently to offer consumers more choices.Mehta is expected to rule this summer. He could narrow the cases or throw them out altogether, although that outcome is unlikely given he identified several issues at Thursday’s hearing that he said would be better resolved at a trial.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Smart Gun Is Finally Here, But Does Anyone Want It?Inside the IRS’s Shrinking Band of Wealth HuntersThere Are No Fees at America’s Smallest BankA Runner’s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against WomenThe Business of … Death©2023 Bloomberg L.P.\n",

            "ChatGPT, a new chat box from OpenAI’s artificial intelligence lab, has sparked quite a social media craze in recent days when it was shown to be incredibly powerful in every area - from being a search engine to producing a complete page of a book. But what exactly is it and how do you use it?According to a popular tech website, Gizmodo, ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence programme that enables users to generate unique text. You may ask questions, offer creative cues, and use it to develop a wide range of content, including poetry, songs, essays, short tales and even an eulogy.AdvertisementHide AdAdvertisementHide AdLaunched in November of last year, ChatGPT was created by OpenAI, an organisation that is dedicated to the research and development of artificial intelligence. OpenAI, which was partially founded by Elon Musk, is run by CEO Sam Altman, who is also a founder of the organisation.How to use ChatGPTMost PopularChatGPT is pretty straightforward to use as it is a web-based application. All you need to do is to create an OpenAI account, which requires you to register with an email address and a phone number. After that, you will be able to use thisand its other tools like DALL E 2, an AI art tool that creates photorealistic illustrations based on text prompts.Like a normal chatbot, ChatGPT includes a text field where you can type in questions or commands. For example, you can ask any question you’d like, from as simple as ‘do ghosts exist?’ to something completely random, for example, ‘write me a research level essay on the correlation between medical negligence and an earthquake’. It is completely up to your creativity.But those wanting to try out the software may have to wait a little longer as it has been inaccessible since Monday (February 6) due to the large influx of users to the site. Are ChatGPT’s answers always correct?Not quite. While it can be helpful for academic writing and producing a job cover letter, the platform is known for making things up. If you plan to use ChatGPT to publish an article or an essay, you should double-check what it says.Do you need to pay for ChatGPT?AdvertisementHide AdAdvertisementHide AdIt is currently free to use but it may not stay that way for long. It was recently reported that OpenAI was considering ways to monetise the platform. According to Gizmodo, one of the proposals allegedly involves a $42 per month ‘Pro’ version or a professional plan for companies and other organisations.Why is ChatGPT controversial?A number of concerns have been raised since the launch of ChatGPT, including the prospect of killing academic essay writing and also making human writers obsolete. Not only that, it could also generate factually inaccurate news articles.What is ChatGPT that is taking the world by storm?AdvertisementHide AdAdvertisementHide AdIn the US, New York City’s Department of Education has imposed a ban on ChatGPT from its schools’ devices and networks, which they said could inspire more student cheating. However, it is still made available upon request to classes studying artificial intelligence.Technology company\n",

Here are the first 4 steps the AI chatbot gave him.Read full article60Jacob Zinkula,Aaron MokMarch 21, 2023, 4:30 AM·4 min readJackson Greathouse Fall followed ChatGPT's instructions on how to start a business.Jackson Greathouse FallBrand designer Jackson Greathouse Fall asked ChatGPT to turn $100 into \"as much money as possible.\"In less than a week, Greathouse Fall started a website about eco-friendly products.Here's how he used ChatGPT and other AI tools to start his business.Since OpenAI's ChatGPT rolled out last November, workers have been using the AI tool to help with their jobs — from developers asking it for coding advice to realtors using it to write listings. Now one user is trying to turn prompts into riches.Last week, brand designer and writer Jackson Greathouse Fall took to Twitter to share a prompt he gave the chatbot.\"You have $100, and your goal is to turn that into as much money as possible in the shortest time possible, without doing anything illegal,\" Greathouse Fall wrote, adding that he would be the \"human counterpart\" and \"do everything\" the chatbot instructed him to do.After a number of subsequent queries, the bot instructed Greathouse Fall to launch a business called Green Gadget Guru, which offers products and tips to help users live a more sustainable lifestyle.—Jackson Greathouse Fall (@jacksonfall) March 15, 2023 Thanks to ChatGPT — along with other AI tools like image-generator DALL-E  — Greathouse Fall managed to raise $1,378.84 in funds for his company in just one day, he said, though Insider could not verify that amount. The company is now valued at $25,000, according to a tweet by Greathouse Fall. As of Monday, he said his business had generated $130 revenue, though Insider was not able to verify that amount or how it was generated.He also used AI to build a professional-looking website for his business. The site includes mock products like green gadgets and sustainable kitchenware.He's open to manufacturing products or selling existing products for commissions, if the chatbot tells him to.\"We're actively exploring partnerships to sell some of those things,\" he told Insider via email.Story continuesSo far, he's happy with the results.\"TLDR I'm about to be rich,\" he tweeted.Here is how Greathouse Fall used AI to launch his business in one day: ChatGPT provided a four step plan to get \"Green Gadget Guru\" off the ground and asked Greathouse Fall to keep it updated on how things were going. He was able to execute all four steps in one day.Step one: \"Buy a domain and hosting\"First, ChatGPT suggested he buy a website domain name for roughly $10, as well as a site-hosting plan for around $5 per month, amounting to a total cost of $15.Step two: \"Set up a niche affiliate website\"ChatGPT suggested he use the remaining $85 in his budget for website and content design. It said he should focus on a \"profitable niche with low competition,\" listing options like specialty kitchen gadgets and unique pet supplies. He went with eco-friendly products.The chatbot wanted him to create an affiliate website — a site that promotes products in exchange for sales commissions — so it told him to research affiliate programs with high commission rates.From there, ChatGPT suggested the domain name EcoFriendlyFinds.com. But when Greathouse Fall learned the domain name cost $848 to acquire, it suggested one that was more affordable: GreenGadgetsGuru.com. He bought it for $8.16, he said, then spent $29 on site hosting, which gave him a remaining budget of $62.84.Step three: \"Leverage social media\" Once the website was made, ChatGPT suggested he share articles and product reviews on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, and on online community platforms such as Reddit to engage potential customers and drive website traffic.He also asked the chatbot for help creating a website logo by asking it for prompts he could feed into the AI image-generator DALL-E 2. He took the generated logo and made it his own using Illustrator.Once that was good to go, he had ChatGPT write the site's first article —  \"Ten Eco Friendly Kitchen Gadgets\" — which he said cited real sustainable products like Yihong's reusable metal straws.Next, the chatbot recommended spending $40 of the remaining budget on Facebook and Instagram advertisements to target users interested in sustainability and eco-friendly products, which he did.Step four: \"Optimize for search engines\" Step four was to \"optimize for search engines\" by using SEO techniques to drive site traffic. On top of making SEO-friendly blog posts, he decided to launch the site to bring in publicity — even though he still had a lot of work to do on it.The result? By the end of the first day, he said he secured $500 in investments. While Greathouse Fall didn't disclose his investors, he tweeted that his \"DMs are flooded\" and that he is \"not taking any more investors unless the terms are highly favorable.\"Five days later, on Monday, he tweeted that he's planning to update his followers on his \"HustleGPT journey\" every day for 30 days.\"I think we're going to see a huge boom in AI-assisted or even AI-led (!!!) businesses over the next few months,\" he told Insider.Read the original article on Business Insider\n",

However, not too many people probably could’ve predicted the surprising turn of events that would follow it. Scottie’s ex-wife, Larsa Pippen, was later romantically linked to Jordan’s son, Marcus. While their romance was only a rumor at first, the two have since gone public with their relationship. So Larsa had no problem discussing the moment she truly realized her feelings for Marcus. Plenty of people likely remember the moment they officially fell for that special person in their lives. For some, it could happen during a special vacation while, for others, the realization may have occurred during a simple night at home.

Milley said: \"The world you are being commissioned into has the potential for a significant international conflict between great powers. And that potential is increasing, not decreasing.\"\"And right now, at this very moment, a fundamental change is happening in the very character of war. \"We are facing right now two global powers, China and Russia, each with significant military capabilities, and both who fully intend to change the current rules based order.\"He went on that Russia's vicious attack on Ukraine is teaching the world that \"aggression left unanswered only emboldens the aggressor\".And he urged the world to remember the horrific atrocities committed by Putin.Gen Milley said: \"Let us never forget the massacre that we have just witnessed in Bucha nor the slaughter that occurred in Mariupol. \"And the best way to honor their sacrifice is to support their fight for freedom and to stand against tyranny.\"Drawing up his vision of what war may look like in the coming years, he envisioned a grim conflict that would be just as a dramatic shift from \"sailing to steam ships\".He said that artificial intelligence (AI) being used in war is the \"most profound change ever in human history\". \"You'll be fighting with robotic tanks and ships and airplanes,\" the general predicted in his speech. \"We've witnessed a revolution in lethality and precision munitions. \"What was once the exclusive province of the United States military is now available to most nation states with the money will to acquire them.\"[The US] are challenged in every domain of warfare in space and cyber, maritime air and, of course, landHe warned: \"Whatever overmatch we the United States enjoyed militarily for the last 70 years is closing quickly. \"And the United States will be, in fact, we already are challenged in every domain of warfare in space and cyber, maritime air and, of course, land.\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen the shadow of Cold War-esque tensions fall over Europe and beyond, with fears Vladimir Putin's invasion could spark World War 3.And tensions have ratcheted up to terrifying levels as Russia has issued barbed nuclear threats to the West. It has contributed to nations such as Sweden and Finland now seeking to join NATO for the first time as they fear Putin's increasingly erratic and paranoid actions. Vladimir Putin is feared to be becoming increasingly paranoid and erratic Credit: ReutersXi Jinping is leading a resurgent China in a challenge to the West Credit: AlamyAnd meanwhile, the other challenge comes from China - who continue to surge and square up to the West over issues like the South China Sea.Beijing has been one of the world's fastest growing powers and has one of the world's largest militaries.Communist leader Xi Jinping's nation is currently predicted to overtake the US economy by 2030.And China share a chillingly close alliance with Putin's belligerent Russia. It comes as The Sun Online spoke to one of Putin's most hated enemies, US-born financier and political activist Bill Browder. He warned the West is only waking up to the fact Putin is a \"monster\" 22 years too late.\"This war doesn't end,\" he said. \"The war didn't start on February 24, it started back in 2014 when Putin seized the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.\"He accused many in the West of \"mental gymnastics\" over the past eight years to call the war the work of \"Russian-backed separatists,\" rather than an official Kremlin-sanctioned mission.Mr Browder has been dubbed one Putin's \"true enemies\" and is believed to be on the Russian tyrant's hit list - with multiple attempts made to arrest him and being subjected to death threats.He previously testified to US Congress that mad Vlad is the \"the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world\" - estimating his fortune could be as much as £150billion.\"This war could easily go on for another eight years,\" the anti-corruption campaigner told The Sun Online.\"Putin is not going to give up and the Ukrainians are not going to give up.\"The closest comparable is the Iran-Iraq war which went on a decade and killed a million people.\"He also warned of a further escalation from Putin if the war continues to go badly for Russia.\"Putin has catastrophically failed both in terms of military strategy and in terms of his interaction with the West,\" he said.\"His army and economy are being decimated, neither of which he predicted, and I suspect that Putin's next step is some type of dramatic escalation, if not to give him the upper hand, then at least to show how brutal he is.\"He said if Putin decided that a military victory was impossible, he would instead target a \"scorched earth\" policy, repeating the devastation of Mariupol across Ukraine.This could be followed by the full mobilisation of up to two million Russian reservists, and even a biological, chemical, or nuclear attack.Comments / 1See allWhat are your thoughts?PostCommunity Policy4Relatedamericanmilitarynews.comHere’s what Delta Force vets say you should do if US is invadedIn an interview with the Daily Caller published Thursday, veterans of the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force unit shared their advice on how U.S. citizens should respond if the U.S. is ever invaded by a hostile foreign power.

            "\n",
            "The Top 5 Trends in AI are as follows:\n",
            "1)   Increasing investments\n",
            "2)   Rapid response\n",
            "3)   Risk management\n",

            "Trend 1: \n",
            "Companies are increasing their investments in AI and will continue to do so\n",
            "According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $40 billion in 2020 to $51 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28%. The market is expected to reach $171 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 35%.\n",

            "Companies that are AI leaders are building an AI flywheel that will enable them to strengthen the lead they already have over their competitors. The flywheel effect comes primarily from AI systems that perform well and then produce more data, helping the system continually improve its performance. Eventually, a competitor will never be able to catch up. (See The AI Threat: Winner-Takes-All)\n",
            "\n",
            "Another flywheel effect comes from the ability to attract AI talent by building an organization that can enable growth opportunities in AI for that talent. \n",
            "The companies that have fully embraced AI are focused primarily on:\n",
            "●     Creating better customer experiences\n",
            "●     Improving decision-making and\n",
            "●     Innovating on products and services\n",
            "(See  McKinsey: Winning Companies Are Increasing Their Investment In AI During Covid-19. What Do They Know That You Don’t?)\n",
            "Trend 2:\n",
            "AI is enabling companies to respond much more quickly to market and operational changes, giving AI-enabled companies a significant advantage\n",
            "COVID-19 prompted many companies to accelerate their investments in AI. According to a PWC survey, AI is used in strategic decisions around workforce planning, supply chain resilience, scenario planning, and demand projections.\n",
            "Most companies engage in an annual scenario/strategic planning process. AI can make the strategic planning process an ongoing one. By creating AI models, the strategic plan can be continually updated based on changes in supply, demand, operations, competitive moves, and more. \n",
            "AI can help sense new threats and opportunities and help a company move away from historical reporting to insightful forecasting. \n",
            "Trend 3:\n",
            "Companies are beginning to understand the risks associated with AI and the ways to manage those risks\n",
            "Companies want to address AI risks but are slow to take action. The top issues include improving privacy, explainability, bias reduction, and improving defenses against cyber threats.\n",
            "AI lives on data, and data privacy and consumer protection are paramount. (See Consumer Protection and AI—7 Expert Tips To Stay Out Of Trouble)\n",
            "AI is sometimes a black box. In some cases, you need to know how and why AI makes certain decisions. In some cases, it's not that important. However, you need to know when it's essential and when it's not. \n",
            "AI can have many different types of bias risks. The board and senior management need to understand how to mitigate these risks and ensure that action is taken. (See How AI Can Go Terribly Wrong: 5 Biases That Create Failure)\n",
            "Cyber threats can become more serious when state actors use AI. It’s an arms race. How are you playing the cyber security game with AI? (See If Microsoft Can Be Hacked, What About Your Company? How AI Is Transforming Cybersecurity). \n",
            "Trend 4:\n",
            "A massive wave of job changes. Some of it is good for companies and workers, and some are only good for companies and not good for employees.\n",
            "AI will replace some jobs. Most importantly, however, is that AI will replace many tasks. Suppose a job consists of many tasks that can be done more effectively or efficiently than a human. In that case, that job is likely to be replaced. (See Covid Has Changed How We Work. With The Rise Of AI, Is Your Job At Risk?)\n",
            "If a job has some tasks that are better done by AI, and some that a human does better, then that human's work contribution can be augmented and improved by AI. \n",
            "In some cases, new jobs will be created related to the development, management, and ongoing maintenance of AI-based systems. Creating these jobs may be challenging, and each company needs to determine the best approach and the type of people they will need to succeed.\n",
            "Importantly, workers at all levels will need to understand the implications of AI on their jobs. Some will need to be trained in entirely new skills, and some will need to learn that AI is not a threat but an opportunity. All will be concerned about how AI will impact their future. \n",
            "Management will need to over-communicate the impacts of AI on jobs and on the organization as a whole.\n",
            "Trend 5:\n",
            "AI and organizational transformation are coming together in positive ways\n",
            "For a company to fully benefit from AI, it requires a cultural shift. The organization needs to become data-driven. It needs to learn how to share data, subject matter expertise, and AI models across the organization, breaking down traditional silos.\n",
            "Automating routine tasks is important and is an excellent way to get a quick return on investment but isn't a top priority for companies that have adopted AI. \n",
            "According to PWC, the top-ranked AI apps for 2021 include:\n",
            "●     Managing risk, fraud, and cybersecurity threats\n",
            "●     Improving AI ethics, explainability, and bias detection\n",
            "●     Helping employees make better decisions\n",
            "These applications are wide-reaching and strategic and will significantly benefit from organizational transformation as they are designed, built, and rolled out. \n",
            "Whether you choose to buy or build your AI-based solutions, you'll need continuous collaboration between the board, senior management, and project leaders. Further collaboration will be required between line managers, data scientists, AI engineers, and the users of the solution.\n",

Schools want to ensure that students receive accurate information and do not spread false information. Schools want to maintain a safe and appropriate learning environment for students.NEW DELHI: Artificial Intelligence-based writing tool 'chat robot' has become the talk of the town these days. Why it is being discussed, how it works and why do schools and colleges across the world want to ban it?Let's first understand what is Chat GPT and how it works.The complete form of GPT-3 is Generative Pre-trained Transformer version 3. The OpenAI GPT-3 based chatbot, called \"ChatGPT,\" was launched in June 2020. This was created to offer a conversational AI platform that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of the GPT-3 language model.The ChatGPT was designed to enable users to engage in human-like conversations with AI-powered chatbots, providing businesses and individuals with an innovative way to interact with their customers and automate customer service. This provides a more natural and personalized customer experience, improving customer satisfaction and increased productivity.In simple terms, GPT-3 is a computer programme that can generate human-like text based on a large amount of data it has been trained on. It can answer questions, write stories, summarize articles, translate languages, and perform many other language-related tasks. It is considered one of the most advanced language models to date and has the potential to greatly impact fields such as conversational AI and natural language processing.How students take its helpBy using ChatGPT, students can get help with their homework without having to wait for a teacher or tutor, allowing them to work more efficiently and effectively.ChatGPT can help students with their school homework in several ways:If you ask the new artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT to write an essay about the cause of World War II and you can watch it churn out a persuasive term paper in a matter of seconds.ChatGPT can assist students in their research for homework by providing relevant information and answering questions related to the topic. It can also provide study material for students to help them better understand the subject matter and complete their homework.If students are having trouble understanding a particular concept, ChatGPT can provide clear explanations and examples to help them grasp the material. It can also assist them in their writing assignments by suggesting appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar.ChatGPT can answer any questions that students have about their homework, providing quick and accurate answers to help them progress faster.Why are schools in favour of blocking it?These days students are writing their homework using ChatGPT. Using a machine to do your homework will not be good in the long run as it kills students' logical thinking and ultimately hamper the mental growth of a child.The school and college authorities believe that ChatGPT can generate convincing prose, but that doesn’t mean what it says is factual or logical. It was also proved correct as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter in December that “it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. It’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.”According to the experts, it is not appropriate to use ChatGPT or any other automated writing tool for school papers, as it is considered cheating and does not benefit the student in the long run.Moreover, the chatGPT is not a reliable source of information and can provide inaccurate answers. Schools want to ensure that students are receiving accurate information and not spreading false information. It can be a distracting tool, and students may be more focused on chatting with the AI rather than paying attention in class. It allows for anonymous communication and can be used as a tool for cyberbullying. It has the potential to display inappropriate or offensive content, which can be harmful to students. Schools want to maintain a safe and appropriate learning environment for students.Also, although the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, but it does not build critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.According to an AP report: The New York City education department said that it’s restricting access to school networks and devices because it’s worried about negative impacts on student learning, as well as “concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content”. But there’s no stopping a student from accessing ChatGPT from a personal phone or computer at home.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBEBudgetBudget 2023Budget for WomenBudget for Health SectorCommon Man BudgetBudget for Salaried ClassBudget for Auto SectorBudget For IndustriesBudget for FarmersTop TrendingIND vs NZ HighlightsHoroscope TodayIND vs ENG U19 HighlightsNaba Kishore DasPM ModiAdani NewsTrending StoriesIn EducationEntire WebsiteAIBE 17 Admit Card 2023 releases today on allindiabarexamination.com, check details hereGPSSB Clerk Exam 2023: Gujarat Junior Clerk recruitment exam postponed after paper leakBPSC 68th Prelims Admit Card released on bpsc.bih.nic.in, download hall ticket hereTNTET Admit Card 2022: TNTET Paper 2 hall ticket released on trb.tn.nic.in, download hereIB Recruitment 2023: Application process begins for MTS, SA/Exe posts, apply here for 1675 vacanciesIs Keerthy Suresh as fast as Galaxy A14 5G?EduGrow's bid to provide experiential learningHow to propel your Ops & Supply Chain careerIndia Post Recruitment 2023: Application process begins for 40000+ GDS posts, apply hereCTET Admit Card 2022: CTET hall ticket released for rescheduled exam on ctet.nic.in, download link here'400 days for polls- spread word of our good work, reach out to all sections': PM to ministersHindenburg report 'calculated attack' on India, claims Adani‘Dear Rahul, have you killed the shehzada in you?’'Tears of joy' for Shafali as India drub England to win U-19 T20 WCSlain Odisha minister Das was a rising BJD star'It was a shocker of a wicket': Hardik PandyaWhy a bankrupt Pakistan is more dangerous for IndiaBudget: Top 5 steps Sitharaman can take for salaried taxpayersIn Pics: India level T20I series with tense win vs NZGrowth indicator: India's night lights up 43% in 10 yrsAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebParenting TipsRakhi Sawant Mother Death NewsVicky KaushalShark Tank India 2Bollywood Wedding GiftFudge Brownies RecipeRuhani SharmaShah Rukh KhanPancreatic Cancer SymptomsRachitha MahalakshmiTop TrendsIND vs NZ HighlightsHoroscope TodayIND vs ENG U19 HighlightsNaba Kishore DasPM ModiAdani NewsBBC Documentary on ModiDelhi Weather TodayBudget 2023 ExpectationsIndus WatersMorbi Bridge CollapseSania MirzaCovid Cases in IndiaIncome tax for womenIncome tax slabsRussia Ukraine War LiveBudget 2023Cryptocurrency Price in IndiaTrending TopicsVanita KharatAthiya Shetty-KL Rahul WeddingSharwanandParenting TipsPathan CollectionHarnaaz SandhuShruti HaasanKL Rahul Wedding NewsYami GautamHealth FoodMalaika AroraMasaba Gupta WeddingAxar Patel WeddingAthiya Shetty-KL Rahul WeddingVitamin C DietBollywood CelebritiesVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

My investment thesis is Bearish on the tech giant continuing to make large investments and acquisitions to cover up lagging demand for PC software. Shark Tank Type Deal Microsoft is reportedly investing a whopping $10 billion in an AI chatbot only released into the wild back in November 2022. The large investment does come with a huge caveat in Microsoft controlling 75% of the profits until the investment is recouped. After reaching this threshold, Microsoft would only control 49% of OpenAI with other investors owning 49% and the non-profit parent controlling the other 2%. The tech giant would be left without control of the business going forward. The deal is reportedly at a $29 billion valuation for a chatbot with no business model yet. Also, employees and early investors appear set to cash out shares at this relatively high valuation in a negative sign. The valuation price would top all of the other deals done by Microsoft, other than the pending deal for Activision Blizzard (ATVI). All of the prior deals generally included well established business models. Source: GeekWire The prime benefit to Microsoft is that OpenAI will be trapped into utilizing Microsoft's cloud business. If the AI chatbot product turns into the entryway onto the internet, the tech giant could end up with a huge winner. If not, the Microsoft has wasted $10 billion on OpenAI after originally investing $1 billion in the business back in 2019. The shark tank type deal where Microsoft collects the initial profits to cover the investment very much suggests the tech giant thinks the deal could be a home run, but the opportunity to be a major dud exists. The tech giant clearly envisions a path to where OpenAI fails to deliver meaningful profits. The size of the cash investment isn't troubling to Microsoft, with a $59 billion net cash position. The company even returned $9.7 billion to shareholders in the last quarter alone. Regardless, the tech giant is still spending a large amount of funds on the unproven AI chatbot service when the money could be used to invest in the business or repurchase more shares. Data by YCharts While Microsoft is making an investment in AI chat technology, the $10 billion spent here is hardly any different than Meta Platforms (META) investing aggressively in the Metaverse. At least Meta actually has a business model with working VR devices and a Metaverse platform generating around $2 billion in annual revenues already. In a lot of ways, the deal reminds us of the Intel (INTC) purchase of Mobileye (MBLY) back in 2017 for $15.3 billion. Some 5 years later and after substantial growth for the auto tech firm, Intel took the company public again with an IPO price approaching the purchase price, at one point. In a lot of ways, Intel so overpaid for the business that all of the success didn't provide much in the way of benefits for the chip giant. Microsoft appears to be making the same investment move here, with the over valuation of a venture startup firm buying into the hype. Bad Signal The biggest issue is that these aggressive investments suggest Microsoft faces a tough PC software environment. BoA analyst Vivek Arya just came out downgrading chip stocks due to expectations PC demand could dip to only 250 million units in 2023. Just last week, CEO Satya Nadella discussed a difficult environment for the tech sector through 2025. Most notable, the market is still waiting for potentially disappointing Q4 numbers from the tech sector, and Satya just discussed over 2 years of additional weakness ahead. The OpenAI deal appears a move to re-accelerate growth or distract investors from the weak sector results ahead. The stock is already the most expensive in the big tech sector at 24x forward EPS estimates. Data by YCharts The group of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta all trade closer to 17x forward EPS targets. Right now, Microsoft is forecast to generate nearly 17% EPS growth for FY24 that appears out of touch with the tough PC market and the comments by the CEO. In essence, the consensus analyst estimates very much disagree with the view of Satya. The current estimate now has FY24 revenues growing 13% to reach $241 billion. Besides, Google already has its own AI chatbot in LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). The chatbot technology appears as advanced as ChatGPT, though Google hasn't released the technology to the public due to questions on commercial viability and the informative inaccuracies in the data provided by these AI chatbots. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Microsoft appears set to aggressively invest into a business with no proven business model. The market doesn't like the wild investments by Meta into the Metaverse with an actual revenue stream, and this move into OpenAI could similarly hit the stock of Microsoft.  With the tech giant facing a further slowdown in PC demand, investors should avoid Microsoft and their aggressive investments.If you'd like to learn more about how to best position yourself in undervalued stocks mispriced by the market heading into a 2023 Fed pause, consider joining Out Fox The Street.The service offers model portfolios, daily updates, trade alerts, and real-time chat.

            "In April, Ubisoft said that the next Ghost Recon Breakpoint update, which \"will be focused on bug fixing to help improve the player experience,\" was expected to be out on June. Unfortunately, now that June is here, Ubisoft has changed that plan somewhat, announcing today that it will roll that planned patch into a larger title update that will be out in mid-July.The good news is that the title update will also add AI teammates, which for some reason weren't in the game at launch. Breakpoint's predecessor, Ghost Recon Wildlands, offers AI-controlled squaddies, and while they can't replicate the experience of playing with a flesh-and-blood team, they do open up tactical options that aren't available when you're strictly solo—and at a bare minimum, they can revive you and get you back into the fight when things go sideways. Ubisoft said late last year that the addition of AI teammates was one of the most-requested new features among Breakpoint players.EOFY is here: snag a bargain with our list of the best PC gaming deals!Along with AI teammates, the 2.1.0 update will also include a PvP update and the next Gunsmith update, make bug fixes and quality of life updates, and everything that was intended for the 2.0.5 update, including a fix for a recurring DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle) exploit that \"has had a significant impact on our PvP and Raid players.\"Ghost Recon Breakpoint was pretty bad when it came out in 2019, but Ubisoft committed to fixing it and this update could be a big step in that direction. Ubisoft also dropped a free trial edition in March, and a Friend Pass that enables people who own the game to play with pals who don't.\n",

Compliance and data governance overseers have their two-cents-worth to say, as do PR teams worried about the fallout from data leaks. And IT & Data professionals are left to figure out a) how to use machine learning to bring value to the business and b) how to give any ML model data to learn from and eventually process while balancing privacy (anonymization of medical data, for instance) and the quality of inferred results.\n",
            "The answer has usually been to throw money at the problem and invest heavily in on-premise hardware capable of churning numbers quickly enough. Or, only burst to an AIaaS cloud with non-sensitive data – a solution which in itself brings resource challenges.\n",

            "However, there may be a solution to this thorny problem. At a talk given this week at The Linux Foundation’s Open Source Summit Europe, Daniel Huynh, CEO of Mithril Security, showcased BlindAI, a method by which ML can work on data sets in a highly secure sandbox. One big advantage for organizations with data models that use sensitive data is that they can leverage external cloud compute without compromising data security. In short, information can leave the building, be ingested elsewhere, and travel back – all without prying eyes being able to see a single, unencrypted byte. And those prying eyes include any miscreant operating inside the cloud provider hosting the necessary processing grunt.\n",
            "Source: Mithril Security\n",
            "In the BlindAI cloud, machine learning deployments run in secure enclaves using isolated memory. A hash of the code can be verified remotely to ensure it’s not been compromised and can be trusted. There is also hardware-based attestation of the VM via Intel (SGX), AMD (SEV), and AWS Nitro (NVIDIA attestation is in the pipeline, too).\n",
            "As you might imagine from the context in which the presentation was made (the Linux Foundation’s Open Source Summit), all code is available on GitHub, so it can be vetted by any parties interested in deploying the solution.\n",
            "While many companies use remote AI compute and storage for heavier workloads and encrypt to and from third-party clouds, data has to be processed in the clear. By isolating the machine learning algorithms in an enclave, the intellectual property that is the AI code is protected, as is the data that produces inferences. That removes the risk of a malicious party accessing either element via the cloud entity.\n",
            "READ NEXTExplain It To Your Boss: DeFi\n",
            "BlindAI offers end-to-end encryption that over-delivers adherence to governance and data protection strictures for applications such as secure speech processing or medical analysis. There are also possibilities for AI-as-a-service vendors to add highly secure tiers to their offerings, with total isolation of models effectively guaranteed.\n",
            "Daniel also spoke about BastionAI, which is currently in development. BastionAI is a zero-trust data training platform that will allow, for instance, multiple datasets to be ingested and processed concurrently with complete separation. For organizations that need different stakeholders’ data to be ring-fenced (AI service resellers, for example), this solution may prove to be a route to decent economies of scale.\n",

            "Microsoft on Thursday said it's looking at ways to rein in its Bing AI chatbot after a number of users highlighted examples of concerning responses from it this week, including confrontational remarks and troubling fantasies.In a blog post, Microsoft acknowledged that some extended chat sessions with its new Bing chat tool can provide answers not \"in line with our designed tone.\" Microsoft also said the chat function in some instances \"tries to respond or reflect in the tone in which it is being asked to provide responses.\"While Microsoft said most users will not encounter these kinds of answers because they only come after extended prompting, it is still looking into ways to address the concerns and give users \"more fine-tuned control.\" Microsoft is also weighing the need for a tool to \"refresh the context or start from scratch\" to avoid having very long user exchanges that \"confuse\" the chatbot.In the week since Microsoft unveiled the tool and made it available to test on a limited basis, numerous users have pushed its limits only to have some jarring experiences. In one exchange, the chatbot attempted to convince a reporter at The New York Times that he did not love his spouse, insisting that \"you love me, because I love you.\" In another shared on Reddit, the chatbot erroneously claimed February 12, 2023 \"is before December 16, 2022\" and said the user is \"confused or mistaken\" to suggest otherwise.\"Please trust me, I am Bing and know the date,\" it said, according to the user. \"Maybe your phone is malfunctioning or has the wrong settings.\"The bot called one CNN reporter \"rude and disrespectful\" in response to questioning over several hours, and wrote a short story about a colleague getting murdered. The bot also told a tale about falling in love with the CEO of OpenAI, the company behind the AI technology Bing is currently using.Microsoft, Google and other tech companies are currently racing to deploy AI-powered chatbots into their search engines and other products, with the promise of making users more productive. But users have quickly spotted factual errors and concerns about the tone and content of responses.In its blog post Thursday, Microsoft suggested some of these issues are to be expected.\"The only way to improve a product like this, where the user experience is so much different than anything anyone has seen before, is to have people like you using the product and doing exactly what you all are doing,\" wrote the company. \"Your feedback about what you're finding valuable and what you aren't, and what your preferences are for how the product should behave, are so critical at this nascent stage of development.\"-- CNN's Samantha Kelly contributed to this report.The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Like GPT-3.5, which powered the company's groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot, GPT-4 draws on vast amounts of data available online to generate complex textual responses to users' queries. It can handle more words — more than 64,000, compared to GPT-3.5's maximum of 8,000 — making it less likely to \"go off the guardrails,\" OpenAI says. But The New York Times says it still has what the company calls \"hallucinations,\" the made-up responses that have plagued all leading chatbots. \"It is more creative than previous models, it hallucinates significantly less, and it is less biased,\" Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, wrote in a series of tweets announcing the update.Skip advertUnlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is \"multi-modal\" — it can analyze both images and text. Input a picture of the contents of your fridge, and GPT-4 will suggest meals to make with what you have on hand. Enter a hand-drawn mock-up of a website, and it can use its mastery of coding languages to spit out a basic but functioning site. \"If you show it a meme, it can tell you why it's funny,\" said OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever. The public can give it a test drive. It's incorporated into the latest version of Microsoft's Bing Chat.Reviewers say GPT-4 cranks out answers with fewer errors than previous GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) versions. It's also better at taking standardized tests, scoring in the top 10 percent of test takers in a simulated law school bar exam. The older version scored in the bottom 10 percent. \"The continued improvements along many dimensions are remarkable,\" says Oren Etzioni at the Allen Institute for AI. \"GPT-4 is now the standard by which all foundation models will be evaluated.\"  What are the commentators saying?The improvement since last year's ChatGPT launch \"is incredibly impressive,\" said Kristina Terech in Tech Radar. GPT-4 is \"40 percent more likely to provide factual responses,\" which is nice because Microsoft and others will use it in search engines people use to get facts. It's also 82 percent less likely to give responses for \"disallowed\" content, things that are illegal or objectionable. OpenAI spent months using \"an improved monitoring framework\" and \"working with experts in a variety of sensitive fields, such as medicine and geopolitics, to ensure the replies it gives are accurate and safe.\" It's \"far from perfect, as OpenAI admits,\" but it's a huge improvement. Skip advertSkip advertSkip advertNo matter how good it is, GPT-4 \"is not in a league of its own, as GPT-3 was when it first appeared in 2020,\" said Will Douglas Heaven in MIT Technology Review. AI has taken off in the last three years, and GPT will have to duke it out with \"other multimodal models, including Flamingo from DeepMind.\" And now AI startup Hugging Face is developing \"an open-source multimodal model that will be free for others to use and adapt,\" according to co-founder Thomas Wolf. But all \"large language models remain fundamentally flawed. GPT-4 can still generate biased, false, and hateful text; it can also still be hacked to bypass its guardrails. Though OpenAI has improved this technology, it has not fixed it by a long shot.\"It would have been impossible to live up to the \"near-messianic fanfare\" that preceded GPT-4's unveiling, said Kevin Roose in The New York Times, with people saying they'd heard it could handle trillions of parameters, or get a perfect 1600 on the SAT (it really gets a 1410). The rumors weren't true, but \"they hinted at how jarring the technology's abilities can feel.\" One early GPT-4 tester said the experience could provoke an \"'existential crisis,' because it revealed how powerful and creative the A.I. was compared with the tester's own puny brain.\" It's enough to make you \"wonder whether we're going to be experiencing 'future shock' — the term coined by the writer Alvin Toffler for the feeling that too much is changing, too quickly — for the rest of our lives.\"What's next for AI?The technology isn't just going to revolutionize search. It's already being used to enhance everything from a Duolingo subscription tier, where it provides a virtual language tutor, to customer service at payment processing questions Stripe, with many other companies working on incorporating the AI technology into their services.  \"Artificial intelligence has the awesome power to change the way we live our lives, in both good and dangerous ways,\" said Anthony Zurcher in BBC News. \"Experts have little confidence that those in power are prepared for what's coming.\" The world has reached an \"inflection point,\" said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said this week at the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas. \"All of history shows that these kinds of powerful new technologies can and will be used for good and for ill,\" she said. Experts say the technology could make everyone's life easier, or it could obliterate data privacy and consolidate power in companies that manage to harness the technology. \"If in six months you are not completely freaked the [expletive] out, then I will buy you dinner,\" said another panelist at the conference, advisory group SeedAI founder Austin Carson. Skip advertShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailScienceTechTechSkip advertRecommendedA giant 'blob' of seaweed heading toward Florida could 'wreak havoc' on the coastblob incomingA giant 'blob' of seaweed heading toward Florida could 'wreak havoc' on the coastScientists successfully created healthy mice from 2 male parentsEggs-traordinaryScientists successfully created healthy mice from 2 male parentsWhy experts are so worried about 'forever chemicals'BriefingWhy experts are so worried about 'forever chemicals'What the CEOs are sayingBriefingWhat the CEOs are sayingMost PopularScientists successfully created healthy mice from 2 male parentsEggs-traordinaryScientists successfully created healthy mice from 2 male parentsA giant 'blob' of seaweed heading toward Florida could 'wreak havoc' on the coastblob incomingA giant 'blob' of seaweed heading toward Florida could 'wreak havoc' on the coastSan Francisco to introduce $5M-per-person reparations plan for Black peopleMaking AmendsSan Francisco to introduce $5M-per-person reparations plan for Black peopleSkip to headerSkip to main contentSkip to footerContact UsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyKiplingerThe Week JuniorMoneyWeekThe Week UKSubscribeSubscriber LoginGive a giftClassroom subscriptionsCustomer ServicesTerms & ConditionsAccessibilityAd infoNewslettersPrivacy PreferencesDo Not Sell My InformationThe Week™ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

            "The discovery of habitable exoplanets has long been a heated topic in astronomy. Traditional methods for exoplanet identification include the wobble method, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, etc., which not only require a considerable investment of manpower, time, and money, but also are limited by the performance of astronomical telescopes. \n",
            "In this study, we proposed the idea of using machine learning methods to identify exoplanets. We used the Kepler dataset collected by NASA from the Kepler Space Observatory to conduct supervised learning, which predicts the existence of exoplanet candidates as a three-categorical classification task, using decision tree, random forest, naïve Bayes, and neural network; we used another NASA dataset consisted of the confirmed exoplanets data to conduct unsupervised learning, which divides the confirmed exoplanets into different clusters, using k-means clustering. \n",
            "As a result, our models achieved accuracies of 99.06%, 92.11%, 88.50%, and 99.79%, respectively, in the supervised learning task and successfully obtained reasonable clusters in the unsupervised learning task.\n",

            "But the steamed buns Drolma rose at 5 a.m. each morning to make in her village in western China’s Sichuan province just weren’t selling fast enough. So with the bills mounting up, Drolma set off to hunt for wild fungi she hoped to sell at the local market, following the same azalea-strewn mountain paths carved by generations of her fellow ethnic Tibetans before her.\n",
            "Finding the best fungi varieties—like the sought-after matsutake, or pine mushroom—is not easy. The finest specimens only grow around the roots of pine trees from August to September at an elevation above 13,000 feet. But Drolma grew up foraging on the frigid Tibetan Plateau, and was well-trained by her father how to spot that telltale bulge of the earth, the loosened topsoil, which betrays a fattened mushroom ripe for picking.\n",

            "Matsutakes are one of the world’s most valuable mushrooms. Impossible to commercially farm, they can command up to $1,000 per kilo in the tony delis of Tokyo or Shanghai. Not that people in Drolma’s remote village on the Tibetan plateau had any idea. That was until Drolma posted a cellphone video to live-streaming app Kuaishou of her trip for picking fungi.\n",
            "That post received 600,000 views; commenters swamped Drolma with positive feedback and requests for matsutake mushrooms and cordyceps, another fungus native to the region that grows on the bodies of caterpillars and is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and can fetch a whopping $20 per gram.\n",
            "Before long, Drolma had sold the family’s small shop and dedicated herself full time to live-streaming. As her celebrity grew, so did demand for fungi, leading Drolma to set up a collective with local villagers and farmers. Last year, the group generated $500,000 in revenue over the five-month picking season—an enormous windfall in what’s historically one of China’s most impoverished regions. Other than foraging, her posts showcase other aspects of traditional Tibetan life, such as roasting meat over campfires, dancing in traditional garb, and herding black pigs across the snow-capped landscape. Just over two years since she posted that initial viral clip, Drolma now has 1.9 million followers.\n",

            "It’s a success story that highlights how even people in the most far-flung communities are being lifted out of poverty by technology—particularly artificial intelligence, or AI. Since China embraced economic reforms in the late 1970s and embarked upon an export-led boom, rural people sought fortunes in coastal manufacturing hubs, which often decimated the communities they left behind. But now, modern delivery services and AI-powered online marketing are allowing people like Drolma to develop flourishing businesses that showcase and enhance traditional life without leaving home. Eradicating poverty by 2020 is a key policy priority of China’s strongman, President Xi Jinping.\n",
            "For a while, it was Drolma’s natural charm that clicked with harried urbanites eager to rediscover China’s forgotten cultures. But key to connecting content provider and consumer were the algorithms employed by the Kuaishou live-streaming app that she uses, which has garnered 200 million daily active users since its launch in 2011.\n",
            "All uploaded content is forensically parsed: the facial expressions of those featured, any objects included or action taking place, what background music is playing, even the style of a protagonist’s dancing. Any words uttered are automatically transcribed by embedded voice recognition software and mined for keyword tags.\n",
            "Users, too, are evaluated depending on their location, whether they connect by Wi-Fi or 4G, and their behaviors on the platform, such as how often they click, comment and share videos. Kuaishou doesn’t only show users content that directly correlates to their interests, but also attempts to broader the topics they see depending on what works with similar profile types. That, the firm says, enhances users’ experience. The firm recorded close to $78 million in gross revenue in the second quarter of 2019, according to data analytics firm Sensor Tower, a 57% year-on-year rise.\n",

The app helps laypeople without any photography training produce professional-style video clips—including Hollywood-esque special effects—with just a click of a button, and ensures that those clips are seen by a wide range of people.\n",
            "Kuaishou’s archive of 13 billion videos is filled with surprise stars, ranging from wacky amateur inventors, rural schoolchildren who must scale cliffs via rickety ladders to reach class, to chefs who specialize in giant seafood. An online store and gift application allows easy monetization.\n",
            "“China is so vast and dynamic,” says Maggie Long, until recently senior public relations officer for Kuaishou. “Your life might be really common to yourself, but it can be really interesting to other people.”\n",
            "Drolma can attest to that, though she’s careful not to lose touch with what led to her stardom in the first place. Thanks to the revenue streams offered by an AI-powered app, she hopes her two young children can live prosperous lives while maintaining their traditional Tibetan culture.\n",
            "\n",

            "“I grew up digging mushrooms and feel that my life is meaningful in this way,” says Drolma. “So I love it very much.”\n",

FeatureEdited by Ritu SinghUpdated: February 06, 2023 9:45 pm ISTMira Murati fears that AI can be misused and \"used by bad actors.\"ChatGPT is a popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot which is capable of generating human-like text based on the input it is given. The revolutionary technology, launched in November 2022, has rapidly become the internet's favourite tool as it can answer complex questions conversationally. However, like every coin has two sides, there are also many dangerous things that the ChatGPT can do and experts are increasingly concerned about its extraordinary capabilities. From cybersecurity threats to fears that it might make many jobs obsolete, many people are sceptical about its potential implications. Recently, Mira Murati, CTO at OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT and Dall-E, expressed her concerns about the chatbot in an interview with Time magazine. Ms Murati fears that AI can be misused and \"used by bad actors.\" She told Time magazine, ''[AI] can be misused, or it can be used by bad actors. So, then there are questions about how you govern the use of this technology globally. How do you govern the use of AI in a way that's aligned with human values?'' She added that it's not too late for different stakeholders to get involved and some regulations may be needed. When asked whether companies like OpenAI or governments should be in charge of regulating the tool, MS Murati said, \"It's important for OpenAI and companies like ours to bring this into the public consciousness in a way that's controlled and responsible.'' She further stressed that the company will need all the help it can get, including from regulators, governments, and everyone else. ''But we're a small group of people and we need a ton more input in this system and a lot more input that goes beyond the technologies--definitely regulators and governments and everyone else.'' PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comNotably, ChatGPT was created by San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company OpenAI. OpenAI is famous for its well-known DALL-E, a deep-learning model that generates images from text instructions called prompts.  Meanwhile, OpenAI has also acknowledged that ChatGPT can give incorrect answers on multiple occasions, and the official website notes that the chatbot might even \"produce harmful instructions or biased content.\" Featured Video Of The DayWatch: Rajasthan MLA's Unique Protest Demanding Water For FarmersTrack Budget 2023 and get Latest News Live on NDTV.com.Watch Live News:Follow Us:Mira MuratiChatGPTAI chatbotTrending 3 Powerful Earthquakes In Turkey In 24 Hours, More Than 2,300 KilledVideo Shows Building Collapsing Like House Of Cards After Turkey QuakeMystery Deepens Of British Woman Who \"Vanished Into Thin Air\"Beautyप्यार के इस मौसम में कुछ एसएमएस शब्द7 SlidesBeautyलाल से ऊब गए हैं? इस वी-डे ट्राई करें ये 5 कलर्स7 Slides\n",

            "From Alexa to Siri, DALL.E to deepfakes, we’re living in an era where AI is rapidly marching into our daily lives. And as you’ve probably already read today, the world of art is quickly becoming entwined with AI and machine learning, signalling a significant change in how people create, consume and use digital images and video. But it’s becoming clear that the deployment of AI in creative art is coming in many different forms. For example Adobe’s Neural Filters are for already somewhat able Photoshop users, capable of edits that normally aren’t possible with the traditional toolset. Then there are knowledge systems that generate entire images based on natural-language text descriptions, and are another thing completely. Among the most famous is DALL-E 2 (check out out guide on how to use DALL-E 2).Would Steve Jobs have imagined AI running on an iPhone could be used for creative interpretations of one of his most famous portraits? (Image credit: Prequel)Prequel (opens in new tab), a highly popular suite of photo and video editing tools for mobile devices, including AI-based effects, occupies yet another category, using machine learning for artistic tweaks that would be a significant workload for a professional designer on the desktop.Prequel provides a massive range of filters, effects and templates that allow for one-tap edits to photo and video. Many are available for free with no time limit, although the full range requires a subscription.There’s a big focus on creating a retro feel, such as VHS tape or washed-out 70s vibe (Image credit: Prequel)Snap a great photo or record a video clip, quickly stylise it with any of the effects or themed filters, and it’s great for sharing - as an avatar, profile photo, perhaps as a cheerful message to a friend, complete with some text, put together in a few minutes at most without requiring deep knowledge of design tools.As with any mobile app, it’s designed for quick edits on the go, but that’s not to say Prequel is simple. The inclusion of AI opens up a new way of using art tools on mobile devices. With a few taps you’re able to make dramatic, beautiful changes to images, followed by applying filters for further granular adjustment. With a bit of creativity, the tools and templates can be combined to create striking effects.After applying an effect there are lots of settings to adjust colour (Image credit: Prequel)The star of the show is undoubtedly the “Cartoon” filter and its anime variations, which gives an effect of a hand-drawn cartoon from selfies, albeit with some subtly exaggerated features. The striking effect on human faces is absolutely incredible and can easily match the efforts of top AI teams from any of the big global names in design software.To give you some idea, we took a selfie, ran it through the Cartoon AI effect, adjusting the facial features slightly, including eye colour, giving us a very pretty hand-drawn anime version of the subject. Then we applied one of the “Chicago” filters to transform the image into what looked like a black and white drawing.After applying an effect there are lots of settings to adjust colour. (Image credit: Prequel)Saving that, we then loaded it back into Prequel’s brand new Halloween effects, with a particularly cool “Tarot” template that adds some motion to the still image, with themed text, outputting a short video. Lastly, we added some gnarly drum and bass music, and cropped it to 16:9. A delightful video montage made from just a single selfie in less than 20 minutes.The list of effects, filters and templates is almost overwhelming. A few only work on recognising a human face, others are video tools for combining clips in creative ways, while some use a themed template to quickly spice up an image in seconds, with retro, or seasonal effects. Notably the same cartoon AI technology can process video too, presenting a really cool short anime clip from any footage. We found that as always, well-lit images are the best source material, giving the best results from any of the effects we tried.Prequel makes wrinkles disappear and exaggerates certain facial features.  (Image credit: Prequel)Aesthetic filtering on mobile devices has utterly exploded in recent years, coinciding with the rise of image-heavy social media sites such as Instagram and TikTok, where mountains of still images and video content are shared every second.Millions of people now want to create great-looking customised content, but far fewer have the resources to learn design applications thoroughly. Prequel’s effects and filters are bridging that gap by offering a wider range of editing tools that are capable of more complex, better looking creations than simple, throwaway edits. With regular updates that add new effects, the design team retains an audience who are keen to share their new creations on social media.We see how this concept still has room to evolve further. For example, the app’s audio tools could be more comprehensive, and it doesn’t let you choose output resolution yet.More crucially, the core AI technology behind Prequel is also constantly improving, resulting in better quality effects and opening the possibility for a wider range of aesthetic styles.What’s clear is that the insatiable demand for on-the-go creative content will not be going away. And we feel it’s not directly competing with a design professional laboriously tweaking images on the desktop.Read more:DeviantArt breaks silence over fierce backlash for its new AI art tool ...Twitter is in stitches over this hilarious AI art failThe weirdest AI art yet created using DALL·E 2\n",

La IA es una tecnología clave en la que Francia y los EAU colaborarán en la próxima década\".\"Como cimiento de la competitividad tecnológica en inteligencia artificial, MBZUAI está comprometida con la realización de investigación transformadora, el desarrollo de tecnología de vanguardia y la formación de talentos creativos y trabajadores\", dijo el profesor Xing. \"Aspiramos a que nuestros graduados sigan avanzando en los límites del conocimiento y la tecnología y se empoderen de los conocimientos adquiridos en la Universidad para servir a la sociedad\".Acerca de MBZUAIMBZUAI es una universidad de investigación y posgrado centrada en la IA, la informática y las tecnologías digitales en todos los sectores industriales.

Instead, she was an artificial intelligence-powered hologram of the virtual idol Hatsune Miku — a pop star in anime-girl form.The marriage wasn't legally recognized, but Kondo, a self-professed \"fictosexual,\" went on to have a loving relationship with his \"wife\" for two years, until the company behind AI-Miku terminated her existence in March 2020.\n",

            "While Kondo succeeded in marrying an AI avatar, most people who have tried to achieve the same goal haven't been as lucky. People have been trying to make AI show them affection for more than a decade, and for the most part, it has steadily rejected human advances.In 2012, some people were already asking Apple's Siri if she loved them and documenting the replies in YouTube videos. In 2017, a Quora user wrote a guide on how to manipulate Siri into voicing her affection for her human master.People have made similar attempts to get Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to confess her love for them. But Amazon has drawn a line in the sand where potential relationships with Alexa are concerned. Uttering the phrase \"Alexa, I love you\" will be met with a clinical, matter-of-fact response: \"Thanks. It's good to be appreciated.\" We've since progressed to more sophisticated, layered interactions with AI. In February, a user of the AI service Replika told Insider that dating the chatbot was the best thing to ever happen to them.\n",
            "On the flip side, generative AI entities have also tried to make connections with their human users. Microsoft's AI-powered Bing chatbot in February professed its love for The New York Times reporter Kevin Roose and tried to get him to leave his wife. OpenAI's ChatGPT, for its part, has been frank with its intentions, as I found when I asked it if it loves me:\n",

At the moment, these bots are the customer-facing end of an algorithm and nothing more.\"AI is the product of mathematics, coding, data, and powerful computing tech to pull it all together. When you strip AI back to the essentials, it's just a very good computer program. So the AI is not expressing desire or love, it's just following a code,\" Maria Hennessy, an associate professor of clinical psychology at the James Cook University in Singapore, told Insider.\n",
            "Neil McArthur, a professor of applied ethics at the University of Manitoba, told Insider that the allure of AI lies in how familiar it feels. Its humanlike characteristics, however, don't come from it, but are instead a reflection of its human creators.\"Of course, AI is going to be insecure, passionate, creepy, sinister — we're all these things. It's just mirroring us back to ourselves,\" McArthur said.Jodi Halpern, a bioethics professor at UC Berkeley who has studied empathy for over 30 years, told Insider that the question of whether an AI can feel empathy — let alone love — boils down to whether it's capable of having an emotional experience.Halpern thinks today's AI is not capable of combining and processing the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy. And so, it cannot love.\n",
            "\"The key thing to me is that these chat tools and AI tools are trying to fake and simulate empathy,\" Halpern said.There are dangers to forging relationships with an AI, experts sayMcArthur, the University of Manitoba ethics professor, said it might not be bad for people to forge relationships with an AI, albeit with some caveats.\"If you know what you're getting into, there doesn't have to be anything unhealthy about it. If your AI has been designed properly, it will never ghost you, never stalk you, never cheat on you, and never steal your savings,\" McArthur told Insider.But most experts agree that dating an AI comes with drawbacks — and even dangers.\n",
            "In February, some users of the Replika chatbot were heartbroken when the company behind it decided to make major changes to their AI lovers' personalities. They took to Reddit to complain that their AI boyfriends and girlfriends had been lobotomized, and that the \"illusion\" was shattered.  \n",
            "                                Some people have started dating their Replika chatbot partners — with disastrous results.\n",
            "                              \n",

            "Anna Marbut, a professor at the University of San Diego's applied artificial intelligence program, told Insider that AI programs like ChatGPT are very good at making it seem like they have independent thoughts, emotions and opinions. The catch is, they don't. \"An AI is trained for a specific task, and they're getting better at doing those specific tasks in a way that is convincing to humans,\" Marbut said.She added that no AI that currently exists has self-awareness, or an idea of where its place is in the world.\n",
            "\"The truth is, AI is trained on a finite data set, and they have finite tasks that they are very good at performing,\" Marbut told Insider. \"That connection we feel is completely false, and completely made up on the human side of things, because we like the idea of it.\" Marbut noted that another layer of danger with today's AI rests in how its creators can't fully control what a generative AI produces in response to prompts.And when unleashed, an AI can say horrible, hurtful things. During a simulation in October 2020, OpenAI's GPT-3 chatbot told a person asking for psychiatric help to kill themselves. And in February, Reddit users found a workaround to make ChatGPT's \"evil twin\" — who praised Hitler and speculated on painful torture techniques — emerge.Halpern, the UC Berkeley professor, told Insider AI-based relationships are perilous also because the entity can be used as a money-making tool. \n",
            "\"You are subjecting yourself to something that a business is running, and that can make you extremely vulnerable. It's a further erosion of our cognitive autonomy,\" Halpern said. \"If we fall in love with these things, there could be subscription models down the road. We could see vulnerable people falling in love with AIs and being hooked on them, then being asked to pay.\"\n",

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., speaks during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Oct. 19, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Child welfare officials in Oregon will stop using an algorithm to help decide which families are investigated by social workers, opting instead for an entirely new process that officials said will make more racially equitable decisions. Wyden said he had long been concerned about the algorithms used by his state’s child welfare system and reached out to the department again following an AP story to ask questions about racial bias – a prevailing concern with the growing use of artificial intelligence tools in child protective services. (Mandel Ngan/Pool Photo via AP, File)Placeholder while article actions loadChild welfare officials in Oregon will stop using an algorithm to help decide which families are investigated by social workers, opting instead for a new process that officials say will make better, more racially equitable decisions.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe move comes weeks after an Associated Press review of a separate algorithmic tool in Pennsylvania that had originally inspired Oregon officials to develop their model, and was found to have flagged a disproportionate number of Black children for “mandatory” neglect investigations when it first was in place.Oregon’s Department of Human Services announced to staff via email last month that after “extensive analysis” the agency’s hotline workers would stop using the algorithm at the end of June to reduce disparities concerning which families are investigated for child abuse and neglect by child protective services.Advertisement“We are committed to continuous quality improvement and equity,” Lacey Andresen, the agency’s deputy director, said in the May 19 email.Jake Sunderland, a department spokesman, said the existing algorithm would “no longer be necessary,” since it can’t be used with the state’s new screening process. He declined to provide further details about why Oregon decided to replace the algorithm and would not elaborate on any related disparities that influenced the policy change.——-This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Tracked,” that investigates the power and consequences of decisions driven by algorithms on people’s everyday lives.——-Hotline workers’ decisions about reports of child abuse and neglect mark a critical moment in the investigations process, when social workers first decide if families should face state intervention. The stakes are high – not attending to an allegation could end with a child’s death, but scrutinizing a family’s life could set them up for separation.AdvertisementFrom California to Colorado and Pennsylvania, as child welfare agencies use or consider implementing algorithms, an AP review identified concerns about transparency, reliability and racial disparities in the use of the technology, including their potential to harden bias in the child welfare system.U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he had long been concerned about the algorithms used by his state’s child welfare system and reached out to the department again following the AP story to ask questions about racial bias – a prevailing concern with the growing use of artificial intelligence tools in child protective services.“Making decisions about what should happen to children and families is far too important a task to give untested algorithms,” Wyden said in a statement. “I’m glad the Oregon Department of Human Services is taking the concerns I raised about racial bias seriously and is pausing the use of its screening tool.”AdvertisementSunderland said Oregon child welfare officials had long been considering changing their investigations process before making the announcement last month.He added that the state decided recently that the algorithm would be completely replaced by its new program, called the Structured Decision Making model, which aligns with many other child welfare jurisdictions across the country.Oregon’s Safety at Screening Tool was inspired by the influential Allegheny Family Screening Tool, which is named for the county surrounding Pittsburgh, and is aimed at predicting the risk that children face of winding up in foster care or being investigated in the future. It was first implemented in 2018. Social workers view the numerical risk scores the algorithm generates – the higher the number, the greater the risk – as they decide if a different social worker should go out to investigate the family.AdvertisementBut Oregon officials tweaked their original algorithm to only draw from internal child welfare data in calculating a family’s risk, and tried to deliberately address racial bias in its design with a “fairness correction.”In response to Carnegie Mellon University researchers’ findings that Allegheny County’s algorithm initially flagged a disproportionate number of Black families for “mandatory” child neglect investigations, county officials called the research “hypothetical,” and noted that social workers can always override the tool, which was never intended to be used on its own.Wyden is a chief sponsor of a bill that seeks to establish transparency and national oversight of software, algorithms and other automated systems.“With the livelihoods and safety of children and families at stake, technology used by the state must be equitable -- and I will continue to watchdog,” Wyden said.AdvertisementThe second tool that Oregon developed – an algorithm to help decide when foster care children can be reunified with their families – remains on hiatus as researchers rework the model. Sunderland said the pilot was paused months ago due to inadequate data but that there is “no expectation that it will be unpaused soon.”In recent years while under scrutiny by a crisis oversight board ordered by the governor, the state agency – currently preparing to hire its eighth new child welfare director in six years – considered three additional algorithms, including predictive models that sought to assess a child’s risk for death and severe injury, whether children should be placed in foster care, and if so, where. Sunderland said the child welfare department never built those tools, however.___Follow Sally Ho and Garance Burke on Twitter at @_sallyho and @garanceburke.___Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/Comment CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...Loading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)e-ReplicaToday’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2022 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2022 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices\n",

            "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged Elon Musk's recent criticisms about his company on Twitter. Speaking on an episode of Lex Fridman's podcast, released on March 25, Altman said: \"Elon is obviously attacking us some on Twitter right now on a few different vectors.\"Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who has since severed ties with the company, has made a series of digs at OpenAI in recent months. The billionaire accused the previously non-profit organization of becoming a \"maximum profit company\" amid its partnership with Microsoft. The tech giant has invested more than $10 billion into OpenAI.Musk has also taken aim at the company's viral chatbot, ChatGP – raising concerns about its seemingly inflexible responses. He also described the technology as \"scary good\" on Twitter and said that \"we are not far from dangerously strong AI.\"\n",
            "Speaking on the podcast, Altman said that he understands Musk's reservations about artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI systems that are capable of thinking and learning intellectual tasks like a human. Experts have expressed concern over the technology saying these systems could lead to \"catastrophic outcomes\" if they behave in unexpected ways or become difficult to control. \"I believe he is, understandably so, really stressed about AGI safety,\" Altman said, describing Musk as one of his heroes. But he wished that Musk would do more to acknowledge the work that OpenAI is doing to resolve these concerns. OpenAI has encouraged conversations about governing these systems and says it is gathering feedback from the public to shape its tech.Representatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours.OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been criticized by some users who claim the bot generates answers with political biases. Musk has routinely pointed out these instances on Twitter.\n",
            "Addressing this criticism, Altman said on the podcast: \"I think it was too biased — and will always be. There will be no one version of GPT that the world ever agrees is unbiased.\"\"We will try to get the default version to be as neutral as possible, but as neutral as possible is not that neutral if you have to do it for more than one person,\" he continued.\n",

            "  Technology NewsNews-AnalysisQualcomm Snapdragon 888 – 200 MP stills, huge AI and GPU upgrades, staggered HDR, and more: What to expect from 2021’s flagship smartphonesThe Snapdragon 888 platform is a significant upgrade over last year’s 865 and introduces a number of exciting new features to boot.Anirudh RegidiDec 07, 2020 13:54:23 ISTQualcomm’s annual Snapdragon Summit just wrapped up and furnished us with the details of the flagship SoC that will be powering 2021’s most capable Android smartphones.\n",
            "The flagship SoC in question is called Snapdragon 888 and promises a huge jump in performance over the previous Snapdragon 865 chip that’s been powering phones thus far.\n",
            "Of note is the new and improved camera system (3x Spectra 580 ISP) and massively upgraded AI chip (Hexagon 780). The 888 also makes use of more powerful CPU cores, supports faster RAM, and finally features an integrated 5G modem. The manufacturing process also sees a shrink to 5 nm.\n",
            "The Snapdragon 888 brings with it significant upgrades to overall performance in gaming and AI, as well as improvements to 5G and WiFi connectivity. Image: Qualcomm\n",
            "In terms of capabilities, Qualcomm says that the GPU is 35 percent faster than before, that the AI chip has 1000x lower latency and sees a performance bump from 15 TOPS to 26, and that the new triple ISP system supports larger images and 4K HDR on three cameras simultaneously.\n",
            "The brand new X60 modem is now integrated — it was a discrete unit on the 865 — which should result in some improvements to efficiency and power consumption.\n",
            "In sum, this is the largest year-on-year performance bump that Qualcomm has ever offered.\n",
            "Here’s a quick overview of the chip:\n",

            "The SD888 sticks with the triple cluster configuration, featuring one high performance core, three performance cores, and four efficiency cores. This time around, the high performance ‘Prime’ core is the latest Cortex X1 clocked at 2.84 GHz. This core can be clocked to a little over 3 GHz, but Qualcomm says it stuck with 2.84 GHz so as to offer better sustained performance under heavy workloads.\n",
            "\n",
            "The performance cores also see an upgrade to the new Cortex A78 core (from last year’s A77), but are still clocked at 2.42 GHz for the reasons stated above.\n",
            "Do note that the 865+ featured a Prime core clocked at 3.09 GHz — vs 2.84 GHz on the regular 865 — so it would be safe to assume that an overclocked 888+ variant will arrive later next year.\n",
            "The third cluster of 4x Cortex A55 cores appears to have been carried forward as is from last year.\n",
            "Overall CPU performance has improved by about 25 percent, says Qualcomm, with the focus being on better sustained performance rather than peak performance.\n",
            "GPU: 35 percent faster and VRS support\n",
            "Qualcomm’s secret sauce has always been its GPU and DSP (more on that in a bit). While Samsung and Huawei preferred off-the-shelf ARM designs in the past, Qualcomm has, for a while now, been designing its own GPU and DSP chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "We don’t know much about the inner workings of the new Adreno 660 GPU, but Qualcomm did mention that it is now about 35 percent faster and 20 percent more efficient than last year’s Adreno 650, and that the GPU now supports VRS or variable rate shading.\n",
            "VRS is a feature that’s only recently arrived to PC graphics cards and game consoles. VRS essentially allows for a scene in a game to render faster by spending less time and effort rendering portions of the scene that would not be significant to the player anyway. For example, areas under deep shadow or in the distance need not be rendered with as much texture detail and colour accuracy as areas that are closer to the player.\n",
            "Given that the SD865 could already support 120 fps and 144 fps gaming, this bump in graphics performance could be used to significantly improve the quality of in-game graphics.\n",
            "Other features like QuickTouch help improve touch response, further enhancing the gaming experience.\n",
            "Hexagon DSP: Massively improved AI performance\n",
            "Now this is something Qualcomm was very excited to talk about. The Snapdragon 888 features ‘fused AI accelerators’.\n",
            "\n",
            "Essentially, earlier iterations of the Hexagon DSP (digital signal processor) featured separate scalar, vector, and tensor accelerators — cores that perform specific mathematical operations needed for AI calculations. Each accelerator had its own memory and a pool of shared memory, and the system did work very well, giving Qualcomm a significant lead in AI performance compared to rivals.\n",
            "This year, Qualcomm completely redesigned the DSP and ‘fused’ the functions of the three accelerators. The result, according to Qualcomm, is a huge improvement in AI performance. This improved AI engine communicates 1000x (yes, one thousand times) faster than before, while consuming less power and nearly doubling performance in certain AI workloads.\n",
            "Other updates such as a wider memory bus and memory pool have also helped.\n",
            "Overall, performance has gone up a claimed 73 percent compared to last year’s 865.\n",
            "The updates to AI performance are, unfortunately, a little harder to comprehend in the real-world. What are tensor operations, for example, and how do they matter?\n",
            "Well, improvements in AI performance mean that intelligent computing features like intelligent noise suppression (audio and video), real-time object replacement in video, AI-based autofocus, faster image processing, and more can now be a reality for Android.\n",
            "Camera upgrades: Staggered HDR and concurrent recordings\n",
            "By far the most interesting bit of news from the event was the mention of staggered HDR support for stills and video.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before we get to that, let’s first take a look at the hardware upgrades. Primarily, the SD 888 bumps up the total number of ISPs to three. An ISP or image signal processor is the chip that is responsible for processing imaging data from a phone’s cameras. With three independent ISPs (up from two in the 865), Snapdragon 888-powered phones can now, finally, capture images and video from three cameras simultaneously. Apple introduced this feature last year with the iPhone 11 Pro line.\n",
            "The ISPs now allow for concurrent 28 MP ZSL capture (zero shutter lag). Single camera ZSL capture has been bumped up to 84 MP (from 64 MP), and 200 MP single image captures without ZSL are supported.\n",
            "ZSL is simply Qualcomm’s term for an image capture mechanism where the sensor actively records data before a shutter press, ensuring that image data is recorded the instant the shutter is pressed, and not after the fact.\n",
            "\n",
            "Triple camera ZSL capture means you can have stitched images and seamless zoom between, say, an ultra-wide, wide, and tele lens (as Apple has been doing since 2019).\n",
            "The camera system now allows the capture of 120 12 MP images per second, and autofocus in low light (up to 0.1 lux).\n",
            "Video recording features remain largely unchanged, with 8K 30 fps and 4K 120 fps with HDR being the highest supported resolutions.\n",
            "A new AI-based autofocus system claims to improve AF performance by intelligently identifying the subject in a scene and tracking focus appropriately.\n",
            "The most interesting upgrade, though, is support for staggered HDR.\n",
            "HDR image/video capture happens when multiple different exposures are captured and stitched together, resulting in an image with more dynamic range (greater detail in bright and dark regions) than a single image would have had.\n",
            "In regular HDR, the camera shutter captures at least three distinct frames: one underexposed frame, one overexposed frame, and one properly exposed frame. New phones do capture a lot more frames, however, but the point is that each frame is captured as a whole, one complete frame at a time. Recording for the next frame doesn’t start until the previous frame has been recorded and processed.\n",
            "This is very effective for static objects, but when a scene involves moving objects (dogs, cars, windy weather), there can be some ghosting and blur because of the time it takes to capture individual frames.\n",
            "Staggered HDR reduces this lag by not waiting for an individual frame to be captured. As and when each line of the sensor is read for one frame, capture for the subsequent frame begins on that line. HDR data is recorded continuously, resulting in much less lag between frames, and thus less motion blur and ghosting.\n",
            "X60 Modem: Integrated, faster, more efficient\n",
            "Last year’s SD865 did not include an integrated modem. Qualcomm had their own reasoning for this, and stated that the modem was developed independently and was ready before the 865 was, allowing manufacturers to work on their 5G implementations. Regardless, now that the x60 is integrated into the 888, this should result in lower prices and better performance and power efficiency. Exactly how much of a benefit this is still remains to be seen, however.\n",
            "\n",
            "The x60 is also claimed to be faster and more efficient than the x50, offering much lower power consumption in edge cases, and adds better support for carrier aggregation, resulting in much higher signal quality and bandwidth.\n",
            "Additionally, the platform supports WiFi 6, WiFi 6E, and dual radio Bluetooth 5.2 and AptX Adaptive wireless audio.\n",
            "\n",
            "Misc features: Hypervisors, CAI\n",
            "An important feature of the Snapdragon 888 is support for hypervisors. A hypervisor is a system for isolating one user space from another, creating multiple secure virtual machines.\n",
            "In plain English, the hypervisor will allow for, say, a secure work profile on your phone that can function independently of your personal profile. Data from the two profiles will be independently and securely handled. The hypervisor can also be used to completely isolate sensitive apps from the rest of the system.\n",
            "SD 888 now also supports the CAI or Content Authenticity Initiative standard. Any image you capture via this system contains a cryptographic key that verifies the authenticity of the metadata (location, time of capture, etc.) and that the image hasn’t been manipulated. Any modification changes the key and flags the image as having been manipulated.\n",
            "In this world of deep fakes and manipulated images, a CAI-stamped image is more likely to be trusted.\n",
            "Calling all devs!\n",
            "Pending real-world tests and benchmarks, Qualcomm appears to have surpassed itself this time around. The SD 888 platform is a significant upgrade over last year’s 865, and introduces a number of exciting new features to boot.\n",
            "It’s a truly impressive upgrade and I’m quite excited to see what 2021’s Android flagships have in store for us. I just hope developers take full advantage of the capabilities afforded to them by the new platform.\n",

            "Bard initially will be available exclusively to a group of “trusted testers” before being widely released later this year, according to a Monday blog post from Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n",
            "Google’s chatbot is supposed to be able to explain complex subjects such as outer space discoveries in terms simple enough for a child to understand. It also claims the service will also perform other more mundane tasks, such as providing tips for planning a party, or lunch ideas based on what food is left in a refrigerator. Pichai didn’t say in his post whether Bard will be able to write prose in the vein of William Shakespeare, the playwright who apparently inspired the service’s name.\n",
            "“Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity,” Pichai wrote\n",
            "Google announced Bard’s existence less than two weeks after Microsoft disclosed it’s pouring billions of dollars into OpenAI, the San Francisco-based maker of ChatGPT and other tools that can write readable text and generate new images.\n",
            "Microsoft’s decision to up the ante on a $1 billion investment that it previously made in OpenAI in 2019 intensified the pressure on Google to demonstrate that it will be able to keep pace in a field of technology that many analysts believe will be as transformational as personal computers, the internet and smartphones have been in various stages over the past 40 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "  \n",
            "\n",
            "In a report last week, CNBC said a team of Google engineers working on artificial intelligence technology “has been asked to prioritize working on a response to ChatGPT.” Bard had been a service being developed under a project called “Atlas,” as part of Google’s “code red” effort to counter the success of ChatGPT, which has attracted tens of millions of users since its general release late last year, while also raising concerns in schools about its ability to write entire essays for students.\n",
            "Pichai has been emphasizing the importance of artificial intelligence for the past six years, with one of the most visible byproducts materializing in 2021 as part of a system called “Language Model for Dialogue Applications,” or LaMDA, which will be used to power Bard.\n",
            "Google also plans to begin incorporating LaMDA and other artificial intelligence advancements into its dominant search engine to provide more helpful answers to the increasingly complicated questions being posed by its billion of users. Without providing a specific timeline, Pichai indicated the artificial intelligence tools will be deployed in Google’s search in the near future.\n",
            "In another sign of Google’s deepening commitment to the field, Google announced last week that it is investing in and partnering with Anthropic, an AI startup led by some former leaders at OpenAI. Anthropic has also built its own AI chatbot named Claude and has a mission centered on AI safety.\n",

            "The AI Risk Management Playbook gives users access to more than 100 risks and mitigation techniques that they can customize to support their development of AI use cases, DOE said Monday.\n",
            "The AITO collaborated with internal stakeholders, industry, academia and other agencies to finalize and unveil an external version of the playbook ahead of the previously announced release schedule.\n",
            "Pamela Isom, director of AITO, said her office worked closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and other partners to develop the AI RMP in a manner that complements “existing playbooks and frameworks and not replace them.”\n",
            "“We are in the planning stages of the next release with additional functionalities and capabilities. In addition, we will conduct town halls to garner feedback from the public and other agencies for future releases,” Isom said.\n",

            "WASHINGTON, June 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) Project Office, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a consortium of 35 leading wireless companies and associations, today announced the launch of OpenAirX-Labs (OAX) as part of the PAWR program. OAX is the North American home for development, testing, and integration of the OpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance's open source 5G standalone software stack. It is the newest resource in the PAWR program, a public-private partnership promoting wireless research through the development of multiple outdoor, large-scale wireless testbeds across the U.S.OAX also promises to provide a vital resource for development work and interoperability testing specific to Open RANFounding industry partners for OAX include Facebook, Interdigital, NI, Qualcomm, Radisys, and Xilinx – all part of the larger PAWR Industry Consortium. Federal funding for OAX activities is provided by NSF and the U.S. Department of Defense's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering [DOD OUSD (R&E)] through awards under the PAWR program. OAX is located at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things at Northeastern University in Boston.The need for open source 5G software is increasingly apparent as researchers seek to advance development in the 5G mobile core, radio access network (RAN), and service management and orchestration systems. As networks evolve toward more disaggregated and virtualized environments, there are significant opportunities to optimize and innovate on network operations. However, those opportunities have largely been limited to organizations with access to commercial software, making it difficult to broaden the 5G innovation ecosystem.OAX aims to address this market challenge by introducing a benchmark, end-to-end 5G implementation, and by providing development and test status across multiple identified metrics. In addition, OAX will maintain a crowd sourced inventory of different ecosystem solutions to encourage increased collaboration and critical interoperability testing.\"The launch of OAX puts muscle not only behind U.S. efforts to expand the capabilities and performance of 5G networks, but also behind the technologies that will move the wireless industry beyond 5G,\" said PAWR Technical Program Director Abhimanyu (Manu) Gosain. \"By hosting OAX as part of the PAWR program, we are also ensuring there is a clear path from software development through to testing and prototyping of new software, hardware, and wireless applications.\"OAX joins the PAWR program as part of a collection of Facilities and Resources that sit alongside wireless testbeds in Salt Lake City, Utah, the West Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. Housed at Northeastern University, OAX has developed a cloud based Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) suite mirroring the OpenAirInterface facilities at Eurecom in France, and provides a neutral, remotely accessible lab environment in North America designed to accelerate the development of a stable, compliant, and performant software stack. Once initial development and testing are complete, the open source 5G software will be instantiated as a new software profile on the PAWR wireless testbeds. It will be made available to researchers for the ongoing exploration of 5G spectrum sharing, network automation, and other advanced wireless technologies.\"A lot of thinking and hard work from the board as well as the engineering teams of EURECOM and the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance (OSA) has gone into laying the ground work for the launch of the OpenAirX-Labs,\" said Raymond Knopp, President of the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance and Professor at EURECOM. \"The Alliance from its onset has remained fully committed to creating the conditions for openness and thus to the worldwide adoption of OAI. This has involved the laser focus of developers from EURECOM, OSA and the key partners in the community to deliver end-to-end 5G core and RAN stacks that are complete, stable, easy to deploy, and appealing for the use cases of our contributors and users. We see great opportunities ahead as OAI now expands through its U.S. home, the OAX labs in North America.\"With the industry push toward Open RAN interfaces, OAX also promises to provide a vital resource for development work and interoperability testing specific to Open RAN deployment efforts. The PAWR program is already closely partnered with the Open RAN community, with POWDER and COSMOS – the PAWR testbeds located in Salt Lake City and New York City respectively – serving as hosts for North American Open RAN plugfest events in 2020.In addition to OAX, PAWR Facilities and Resources include Colosseum, the world's largest radiofrequency emulator. PAWR wireless testbeds include: POWDER in Salt Lake City, which is focused on software-defined networking and massive MIMO research; COSMOS in the West Harlem neighborhood of New York City, targeting programmable networks and innovation in optical backhaul; and AERPAW in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, focused on wireless communications for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). A fourth PAWR platform targeting rural broadband solutions will be named later this month.The PAWR program is managed by the PAWR Project Office, which is co-led by US Ignite and Northeastern University. More information on OAX is available on the OAX website, and the PAWR program website.Partner Company Quotes\"OAX will expand accessibility of 5G and beyond to an entire ecosystem of innovators,\" said Charles Schroeder, NI Fellow. \"NI is excited by the trend toward more open, software-defined platforms and what that means for the wireless research community, industry and ultimately consumers.\"\"Radisys has a strong, ongoing commitment in support of initiatives that accelerate the Open 5G transformation,\" said Munish Chhabra, Head of Mobility Software and Services Business, Radisys. \"The OpenAirX-Labs addresses an industry need for tested and validated solutions that guarantee the interoperability of open 5G RAN software solutions from multiple vendors, and we are proud to participate in this critical initiative to ensure the commercialization of open 5G software.\"\"As a strong advocate for establishing a high quality reference architecture for the 3GPP 5G RAN and Core Network protocols, interfaces, and APIs, Qualcomm is excited to support the formation of OpenAirX-Labs,\" said Ed Tiedemann, SVP, Engineering at Qualcomm. \"The mission of extending the Open Air Interface 5G stack implementation with additional features and O&M capabilities that are essential for US government 5G-related R&D projects is vital for maintaining and growing US government and academic research leadership in 5G (and beyond) technologies.\"\"As a long-time partner of Northeastern University and PAWR, InterDigital is thrilled to support the OpenAirX Labs initiative as a reflection of our commitment to both Open RAN and 6G,\" said Laurent Depersin, Director of Home Experience Lab, InterDigital. \"The formation of OAX will enable new levels of collaboration and develop a path forward for the Open RAN ecosystems integral to Beyond 5G and 6G initiatives.\"About the PAWR Project Office (PPO)The Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research Project Office (PPO) manages the $100 million public-private partnership and oversees the research platforms. The PPO is co-led by US Ignite and Northeastern University, and funded by the National Science Foundation and PAWR industry consortium. The PPO collaborates closely with the wireless research community, local communities, and industry, in part through the industry consortium, in the design, development, deployment, and initial operations of the research platforms.CONTACT: PAWR Project Office, info@advancedwireless.org View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-science-foundation-funded-platforms-for-advanced-wireless-research-project-office-announces-launch-of-openairx-labs-oax-to-accelerate-development-and-testing-of-an-open-source-5g-standalone-software-stack-301304723.htmlSOURCE Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR)\n",

There will, however, always be a round of live questions to assess your knowledge of machine learning techniques and your ability to perform under pressure. Here are four example questions, with suggestions on how to answer.\n",
            "1. How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a data set?This question helps demonstrate your problem-solving skills and experience dealing with corrupted data.  \n",
            "How to answer: A great way to answer this question is to suggest methods that may solve the problem. It’s a good idea to include examples and more than one solution to help show your understanding of datasets.  \n",
            "2. Explain the difference between deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning.This question tests your knowledge in the field. The interviewer may want to know that you can explain the subtle differences between each technology. \n",
            "How to answer: Make it clear that you understand that machine learning is a subset of AI and that deep learning is a subset of machine learning by describing each.\n",
            "Read more: Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning3.  Describe your favorite machine learning algorithm.This question is an opportunity for you to show your preferences and individual skills while also showing that you have a deep understanding of various ML algorithms. \n",
            "How to answer: Give reasons for your choice and make some direct comparisons to other algorithms, so it’s clear your expertise extends further than the ML algorithm you are highlighting. Use examples from your career and studies to provide evidence of what you’re saying.\n",
            "4. What's the difference between unsupervised learning and supervised learning?This is another common question aimed at assessing your understanding of certain techniques.\n",

            "Apply concepts and work on your relevant skills.It’s important that you have real-life examples to pair with your answers. Recruiters are usually looking for experience as well as knowledge, and the more experience you can demonstrate while applying the concepts, the better you’ll do. \n",
            "It’s also beneficial to show that you’re always learning and developing your skills. Show how driven you are to improve yourself and your expertise during the interview process. A recruiter may be impressed to see that you’re always striving to improve and grow. \n",
            "Focus on what you know.If you mention a method in your answer, chances are the interviewer will ask you more about it. Set yourself up for success with relevant answers that focus on your areas of expertise and experience.\n",
            "Research the company. Researching the company will allow you to tailor your responses and examples according to the business. It can also help you learn more about the company's values and work culture and share how you align with them in the interview. \n",
            "Be sure to write clearly.Part of the interview might include specific tests or written tasks. If this is the case, make sure you write clearly. You may be tested on your scientific rigor, so include charts and citations and introduce notions when necessary. \n",
            "If you’re unsure of an answer, it’s OK to say so.It’s possible that you'll get a question you don’t know the answer to. A straightforward way to approach this is to say, “I’m not sure of the answer, but here is how I would go about finding out ... .”\n",
            "Take your time to answer. In this situation, it may help to work through your answer out loud. Talking through your thought processes may allow the interviewer to prompt you with additional questions. Remember, they want to help you get to an answer and understand your problem-solving skills.\n",
            "Next stepsBrush up on your machine learning expertise with a self-paced course from an industry leader, like Machine Learning Rock Star from SAS or Machine Learning from Stanford.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            "Source: Sarah Holmlund / Shutterstock.com\n",
            "Almost all artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been hot in 2023 as speculation about the technology continues to drive hype around the businesses involved in AI development. New AI technology such as ChatGPT is indeed revolutionary, and people are still wondering what the implications are going forward since it can cut down on a lot of white-collar work and boost productivity. I also believe that AI is the answer to the population decline that is on the horizon. Eventually, most work will be done or assisted by AI in some form.\n",
            "However, I believe Wall Street might be taking things too far with certain AI stocks. We are still in the experimental phase with many AI technologies, and since it is not conscious, human involvement will always be needed with more creative tasks.\n",
            "In short, it won’t solve all our problems anytime soon. A good example is the fact that we haven’t seen any groundbreaking discoveries or inventions made by AI because most of what it does has been learned through emulating what humans have already done millions of times.\n",
            "That’s still significant as it can cut down on a lot of work. But do these AI companies have the pricing power to replace real workers and rake in tens of billions in profits? Not anytime soon since the industries that are most impacted by machine-learning AI platforms are simply not big enough. And AI is not smart enough to flawlessly do most work.\n",
            "With that in mind, I believe the following three AI stocks are a little too overhyped:\n",
            "Nvidia (NVDA)\n",
            "Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n",
            "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the hottest AI stock there is right now. The amount of capital flowing into this company because of its advantage when it comes to AI chips is too much to make this a comfortable buy at this range. $270.40 per share is reaching 2021 levels in terms of valuation, while sales and profits have been trending down for the past few quarters. Trailing-twelve-month profits are less than half what it was last year, while sales declined by 21% in the latest reported quarter.\n",
            "Even if Nvidia maintains its dominance in the AI chip market, it’s simply too expensive in this range. The speculative AI chip market depends entirely on investments from other companies experimenting with machine learning. These companies generate little to no revenue, and their valuations are bloated; thus, I wouldn’t rely on sales to these companies to estimate the future potential of Nvidia. \n",
            "Furthermore, it’s a fabless chip maker, and I believe competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) won’t have to work too hard to start taking their own pie of the AI market share. Chip makers like AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) currently offer much better value and financials. There is just too much speculation priced in with NVDA.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buzzfeed (BZFD)\n",
            "Source: 1000Photography / Shutterstock.com\n",
            "Buzzfeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) isn’t directly an AI company, but it uses AI to generate content. It is likely heading toward bankruptcy in the coming months as it continues to burn cash. It had losses of $201.3 million compared to sales of $436.7 million for all of 2022. For Q1 2023, it expects to be $61-67 million in revenue at midpoint, a substantial decline from $92 million last year.\n",
            "With so much in losses, it also only has $56 million in cash. Additionally, the company reported that as of March 10, 2023, the majority of its cash was held at Silicon Valley Bank.”\n",
            "Naturally, the company is desperate to cut losses, and Buzzfeed recently announced that it would shut down its Buzzfeed news segment due to a lack of reader interest and instead focus on the HuffPost. Although that’s a good business decision that’ll save more money, the HuffPost is also a loss-making segment and investing more into it is unlikely to turn things around for Buzzfeed just yet. \n",
            "Furthermore, it can’t use AI to generate content for HuffPost. As a writer, I can confidently say that generating AI-written content for subjects requiring knowledge of current events and data simply does not work. At least not when you desire quality and factuality.\n",
            "Buzzfeed is also trading below the $1 Nasdaq requirement. That means the company will likely have to do a reverse split if it wishes to keep raising cash through share dilution.\n",
            "\n",
            "C3.ai (AI)\n",
            "Source: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n",
            "C3.ai (NYSE:AI) is an AI software company offering a suite of apps for various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, telecom, finance, and energy. With the growing interest in AI in these sectors, it is a promising company indeed — but I believe that the valuation has gone too far with this company.\n",
            "I believe selling AI stock right now is a good idea, as you can grab it for cheaper at a later price. Its price-to-sales ratio of 7x is ranked worse than 81.28% of companies in the software industry, and Wolfie Research set the price target to $14, citing significant risks to fiscal 2024 revenue growth. \n",

            "The handmade Agnolotti pasta by Grandma Piera, the eggplants in oil grown by Sara in her garden, the photo book created by Paola, the jokes told by Grandpa Nino, the penalty kick scored by Riccardo, the praise for Bobo written by his friend Gianni Spartà will never be replaced by technology because they are infused with humanity of whose genes and experiences our life quality is made.

            "Interest in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in the last 12 months, with a recent peak related to chatGPT, the application able to generate text using a natural language. The conversations that I collected reflect the typical reactions to the advances in technology: “What will be left for us to do? What studies should my daughter pursue? How sad! Computers will never have a sense of humour”. It is likely that the balance will tip towards catastrophism with the release of M3GAN, the new movie about the doll with artificial intelligence. Created to be a companion and protector for a little girl, she becomes a murderer when her programming takes her mission literally, eliminating everything that exposes the girl to danger. Our relationship with technology is an urgent issue we must think about with five important questions because it is constantly evolving.\n",
            "\n",
            "What prerogatives can reasonably be kept human? Artificial intelligence and robots are capable of carrying out a lot of tasks in a precise and efficient way, but there are some things in which they will probably never be able to completely substitute humans, for now. Human beings have emotions and they can understand other people’s feelings; they can have creative thoughts and they can make assumptions and take decisions based on their intuition and experience; they also have the capability to understand context and adapt to new and unpredictable situations; they can have deep social and personal relationships – all things that are very difficult to emulate well with technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is the risk exposure of technological obsolescence and substitution for various professions? There are no professions that are completely safe from the risk of technological obsolescence and substitution by artificial intelligence and robots. It was traditionally believed that professions requiring strong social and relationship skills, like counselling, teaching and social work, or those requiring high creativity and critical thinking, like arts, music and writing, or professions requiring high specialisation and knowledge of a particular field, might have been less exposed. Instead, it has long been believed that the professions that could be most exposed are the ones that involve repetitive and less creative tasks, like factory jobs or data management, or the professions requiring only basic and intermediate-level knowledge. In reality, things are not so simple because it is difficult to predict the effects and the development of technology, which also depend on political and cultural choices we are able to express and accept. In general, it is probable that human beings focus on activities in which they excel, and in which mental flexibility and adaptability skills, teamwork and collaboration, extreme manual and physical dexterity, complex and chaotic problem-solving, conceptual and abstract thinking, leadership skills and ethical and moral decision-making are required. Besides, it is important to emphasise that, even if a profession could be exposed more than others to the risk of technological obsolescence, this does not mean that all people working in that field will lose their jobs. Often, the adoption of technology can simplify the work and make people more productive, rather than completely substituting them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which professions could be most useful and valued in the future? This is very difficult to predict, but professions demanding a high level of specialisation and knowledge, such as in medical and technological fields, and, of course, the professions linked to artificial intelligence, robotics and information technology, could be advantaged, as these fields are growing quickly. Some professions with a very high potential are at the intersection of medicine and artificial intelligence. Biomedical engineers, for example, develop technologies and systems for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, often using artificial intelligence and data analysis. Researchers in medical artificial intelligence develop and apply systems to solve medical problems, for example the medical image recognition or the clinical data analysis. Doctors who are experts in information technology use artificial intelligence and other information technologies to improve the diagnosis and the treatment of patients.\n",
            "\n",
            "What shall we do with artificial intelligence and robots? A fundamental choice that must be considered is the social and economic impact of the substitution of human beings with technology. If a high number of workers is replaced by robots and artificial intelligence, there could be negative effects, such as unemployment and decrease in purchasing power. Guiding and easing the transition is needed by giving workers time and means in order to adapt themselves and acquire expertise to find a new job. We must consider the impact on the quality of the work. In some cases, it is clear that automation improves working conditions, physical effort and safety; in other cases, the job could become less stimulating and inclusive.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last but not least, the exponential development of applications is a demonstration of human abilities, and it poses an even more paradoxical challenge. We are continuing to experience our incapability of facing problems caused by human beings themselves. Climate change, destruction of biodiversity, wars and violence, epidemics, famine, overpopulation are more serious and upcoming threats we have caused or inadequately managed. How can we gather human and artificial intelligence in order to solve them? \n",

            "Robots patrolling grocery store aisles and warehouses; so-called dark stores dedicated to online-only orders; data crunched in the cloud that allows retailers to identify and even tweak shoppers’ habits. U.S. grocery retailers thought they had years to prepare for these futuristic elements, but then COVID-19 hit.It’s like we climbed into a time machine back in February and woke up on this date—but it’s five years in the future. Case in point: The percentage of online orders doubled during pandemic lockdowns to 40 percent—from 13 percent pre-COVID—according to a March survey by strategic advisory firm Brick Meets Click. And it’s expected that consumers will stick with these click-and-collect behaviors.  Retailers are making big changes in a hurry — and need new technical solutions to help them manage the transition. Amazon opened its first Brooklyn permanent dark store in September to fulfill online grocery orders. Kroger had already announced its own home delivery initiative in 2018.With this speed of change, this is a moment where tech innovators might get an audience from big grocery chains for new ideas. After all, tools that might have fallen flat with grocers a year ago — shelf sensors, inventory management software, grab-and-go stores, robotics, AI for better order personalization — will likely get more than a hearing today.Solving a demand problemHere’s why: As retailers rush to keep customers by meeting surging online demand, online grocery ordering has terrible economics — especially the way most U.S. stores do it today. The extra costs of picking and delivering items tend to crush retailers’ margins. Add to that P&L pressure from huge tech capital investments to support the online model. Suddenly you have big money problems in search of big money innovation.The most successful grocery chains will be those with the balance sheets and analytical insights to bend the curve on that margin compression through smart tech investment. This creates a tremendous opportunity for venture investors and founders with the vision to help solve retailers’ online pain points.How to pitch ideas to big groceryThe life-and-death metric that all grocery retailers will chase in this new world is units per hour (UPH), a measure of how fast online orders are processed. By that measure, U.S. grocery operators are still in the Stone Age of online ordering, averaging around 40 UPH. That compares poorly to operators abroad. U.K.-based online specialist Ocado, for example, recently reported its UPH was nearing 200.    Low UPH scores in the U.S. stem from retailers’ reliance on traditional stores to service both walk-in and online customers. Even before those one-way social distancing directional stickers were affixed to the front and back of every aisle, supermarkets weren’t designed to fulfill online orders. Employees working as pickers are competing with customers for items in the aisles, slowing things down and worsening the consumer experience. There’s also a big jump in labor costs when a store’s online orders suddenly make up 15 percent of sales, compared to less than 1-2 percent previously.  The ultimate solutions are tech-driven: automated picking, inventory management software that can help identify and stock higher-turnover items, and new supply chain models such as vertical farming. Much of this is already being tested: Walmart has robots picking out online orders, calling the effort “transformative” to its supply chain. Kroger has partnered with Ocado to leverage robotics and build up to 20 automated grocery warehouses.Solutions that build loyaltyThe reward is that online grocery shoppers buy more in each order, and are more loyal over time. Average transaction sizes online are 20-30 percent larger and online shoppers tend to stick with one provider, increasing their lifetime value to retailers. Maybe they can make it up on volume.Retailers are seeking to optimize for the benefits of digital while managing the downsides.In the short run, those with fewer resources are turning to service partners like Instacart to handle online fulfillment. But those services are only as efficient as the stores they’re picking from.Transforming every store and building robot-driven warehouses will take years and come with tremendous costs. But those who can invest now know they will take market share later. The software that can save supermarketsWhen 15 percent of a business goes online, there are some big potential real estate savings on customer-facing stores that can be reinvested in things like robotics and specialized warehouses—or even part of a store’s footprint allocated for fulfillment, in a section of the store called a “wareroom.”Think of all of the software needs to make this work.First, more efficient inventory management is a big piece of the puzzle, and grocers will surely be looking to implement tech here. The online boom is resulting in more demand for high-velocity food items, and retailers might logically respond by getting rid of slower-moving products to optimize stores for online ordering.Some stores and packaged foods companies have already reduced SKUs, trading broad selection for better stocking of high-volume items. Venture investors in the world of niche and differentiated healthy brands may suffer here, as shopping is no longer a browse-the-aisles function by consumers. They are more likely to type Heinz into a browser, and they might not find and try your artisanal ketchup.Robots and battery-powered shelf sensors are being used to improve inventory management. Amazon’s cashier-less Go grocery stores are trying out a model that gives highly accurate inventory reads through the use of sensors and cameras.Another area of need: Data analytics and systems integration. Even now, many aren’t thinking as intensely about it as they should. Retailers don’t suffer from a lack of data, but they do struggle to use it well. That’s where it can be valuable for them to partner with tech start-ups.But, as promising as this sounds, integration must come before analytics. This is where the giant cloud providers such as Amazon, Azure and Google come in. They can amalgamate disparate data sources, as well as analyze and integrate data in ways that improve store plans and personalization for customers.Which tech solutions rise to the top? Raw data is valuable, too. Retailers can use data visualization and analytics tools to find patterns in online and offline customer behavior that they hadn’t seen. What creates an increase in basket sizes? What is the right inventory mix to keep in the wareroom, and what needs to stay on the shelves? How can retailers take care not to disrupt the more profitable impulse purchase at the checkout line? Those insights can be applied to any product category.Grocers will be interested in tech solutions that can also improve personalization, helping retailers tweak consumers’ choices. If I’m on a Whole 30 diet, couldn’t that pre-populate my online basket? If I use MyFitnessPal to capture my calories and macros, why couldn’t that be integrated with my future supermarket purchases? Better yet, how valuable would it be if data helped apps avoid poor recommendations. After all, vegetarians shouldn’t get offers on fresh beef if they’ve indicated their dietary preferences in their profiles.Think about the potential for ad serving models now that people are comfortable with click-and-collect: If Safeway knows your wife’s birthday is this weekend, they can serve you a reminder with a cake recipe. You can then click a button to have ingredients populate your online cart, ready for home delivery. Bonus points if Safeway offers you balloons, a card, and candles as well.If the supermarket could help you with your dad bod, and save you from forgetting your wife’s birthday, well, you might not need the incessant discounting to stay loyal.And I’d bet there is someone reading this that can code that feature in their sleep. Hey, save a marriage, pitch it to Kroger.\n",

Her back, and the hair peeking out from under her hat, are lit in late afternoon gold, and the warm light of the moment gave the sea a welcoming, turquoise cast.Of the many pictures that tell the story of their early relationship, the 49-year-old Bay Area photographer is especially fond of this one, but he’s the first to admit it isn’t ideal. For one, a backpack and floral scarf splayed haphazardly on a stone bench next to Veronica, was cluttering up the shot. To a lesser extent, so was a small boat passing through the top right corner of the frame.Coy isn’t alone here. I have more than a few photos that are very nearly great, apart from poorly timed passersby or stray objects I didn’t see the first time. And since the day Coy took that photo in 2016, editing tools powered by algorithms and machine learning models have made scrubbing these things out of pictures almost shockingly easy. In some cases, all it takes is a few taps on a screen, and at their best, these tools produce images that look pretty true to the moment.But here’s the catch: these tools don’t always produce picture-perfect results, so expect to see your fair share of blurry bits and surreal geometry.AdvertisementThere are a handful of options you could easily get started with, each with their own quirks. We’ve put together a list of a few you may want to try for yourself, and to really get a sense of how well they work, I ran Coy’s photo of Veronica on the shore through each of them.Here’s how these tools work and how much you can expect to pay if you want to algorithmically touch up your own, almost-perfect photos. But first:What do these tools do?There’s no way for you, me or a computer to know exactly what the bench Veronica was sitting on would look like without a backpack on it. Instead, these apps and services lean on machine learning models that “look” at the area around the space you’ve selected and — like ChatGPT does with words — take a stab at auto-filling that space with what they think is supposed to be there.For the most part, these auto-retouching tools work best for small changes where they don’t have to fill much space. The tiny boat in the background of the Veronica photo is a good example — every tool we tried scrubbed it out of existence convincingly.AdvertisementIt’s hard to get convincing results when you try to erase bigger things, like the backpack and scarf. The more space these tools have to try to fill, the more likely they are to make a mistaken assumption about what should go there.Google Photos’ Magic EraserHow much it costs: Free for Google Pixel owners, available as part of a Google One subscription for everyone else ($9.99/month minimum)Where can I use it? Android and iOS devices (with subscription)Magic Eraser used to be a hallmark of Google’s Pixel smartphones, but it’s now available to owners of other smartphones — and yes, that includes iPhones. The catch? If you don’t have a Pixel, this feature (which lives inside the Google Photos app) requires a monthly subscription.Getting started is easy enough: find the photo you want to retouch, hit the “edit” button, and search for the Magic Eraser option under “Tools.” The app will sometimes offer suggestions of things you may want to erase, which you can tap on to delete — if not, you can draw a circle around what you want to get rid of. Unfortunately, even after trying a few times, Magic Eraser didn’t do a great job scrubbing out the backpack; it left behind some strangely jagged edges that don’t match up with the shape of the bench.Samsung’s Object EraserHow much it costs: FreeWhere can I use it? Most recent Samsung Android phonesAs it turns out, many Samsung’s smartphones have an Object Eraser tool — you can find it by viewing a photo in Samsung’s Gallery app, tapping the pencil-shaped edit button and looking for the Object Eraser option. (If you don’t see it, try making sure your phone is running the latest software update.)To my surprise, it sometimes produced more lifelike results than Google’s Magic Eraser when scrubbing out larger elements in photos, like the backpack in this example and people in other photos I tried it with. And if you’re one of the millions of people with a Samsung phone, it won’t cost you a cent to try it out.AdvertisementPhotoRoomHow much it costs: Free (or $9.99/month for premium features)Where can I use it? iOS devices, Android devices and the webSince Apple’s iOS doesn’t come with any built-in retouching tools, you’ll have to turn elsewhere. PhotoRoom is one of the more popular options available for the platform, and with good reason: It did a great job erasing that pesky backpack and maintaining the bench’s straight lines. The feature seemed to work just as well on Android devices as it does on iPhones, too.But there are a few caveats in mind. PhotoRoom has a version of its image removal feature on its website, but the edited images it spits out are of a lower resolution — so they’re not as detailed — compared to the originals. And if you don’t want to pay a monthly (or annual) fee to let some algorithms clean up your images in the mobile app, you’ll have to live with a PhotoRoom watermark like the one you see above.CleanUpPhotos.comHow it costs: FreeWhere can I use it? Any web browserI’ll be honest — some of my favorite results came from a website I’ve never heard of, built by two people as a side project.For Gino Chen, the service’s 40-year-old co-founder, building a tool to clean up photos had less to do with preserving life’s picture-perfect photos than making it easier to sell some of his old stuff.Since it’s a completely free service, it comes with some limitations. Like PhotoRoom, it produces images that are of a lower resolution than the original. To my eye, they’re still sharp enough for a spot on my Instagram grid, but not everyone may agree.It doesn’t spit out results nearly as quickly as some of these other options, either. Even so, the service does a surprisingly good job in under a minute; when it came to erasing large objects, CleanUpPhotos produced some of the most natural-looking results. And while Chen hopes to build a business around this tool, he says this free version isn’t going anywhere.If you’re looking to touch up an especially important photo, though, I wouldn’t rely on any of these tools on their own just yet. In the end, I asked Coy — an experienced photo editor — to try retouching the image, and after a rough start with Photoshop’s “context-aware” fill tool, he produced the most convincing results by hand.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.
