# NLP-UnveilingTheInfluenceOfAiInIndustries

Executive Summary
The objective of this project is to identify the industries and job lines that are most likely to be impacted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in the next several years and provide actionable recommendations on how to automate tasks and improve employee productivity. The analysis was conducted using the text of approximately 200,000 news articles on topics related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied to extract meaningful insights from the unstructured text.

Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative technology with numerous applications, including medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and chatbots. AI has made significant advancements due to the development of large language models (LLMs). The release of ChatGPT has contributed to a boost in the development and adoption of AI technologies. These advancements opened up new possibilities for automation, improved productivity, and the creation of intelligent systems.

Findings
Industries that rely on human touch, such as education, news, media, and art, express concerns about the potential loss of human sentiment, emotion, creativity, and judgment. Conversely, industries with prior experience in handling data, like business, finance, healthcare, and insurance, exhibit more positive sentiments towards AI. Different industries have varying sentiments towards AI based on their job functions and experiences. In industries accepting AI, there will be a reduction in mundane jobs and manual labor.
